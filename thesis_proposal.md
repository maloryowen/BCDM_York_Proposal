#Introduction

Desert ecosystems are threatened. Results of anthropogenic actions like climate change and habitat fragmentation are perpetuating desert degradation. Specifcally, climate change increases severe weather such as droughts and flooding (cite) and human development fragments and destroys habitats (cite). In the American Southwest, arid ecosystems are home to dozens of endangered plants and animals (cite), and provide ecosystem services to humans (cite). In order to restore the region and mitigate the effects of climate change and human development, we must understand the connections which proliferate life in the desert. 

Often used interchangeability with facilitation, positive interactions are any associative action between interspecifics where one species benefits another's fitness in some capacity (cite). The further scientists determine the prevalence and strength of positive interactions in determining an ecosystem, the more communities are viewed as interconnected and non-random [Callaway1997]. This suggests that positive interactions amoungst plants and animals are one of the driving forces behind an ecosystem's development. For this reason, identifying the mechanisms of facilitation is an avenue to understanding how certain ecosystems disperse and form. 

Uncoincidentally, facilitators, also known as benefactors, often take the form of a keystone species within an ecosystem (cite). Facilitators are keystone species because of their ability to provide resources or protect against stessors (cite). In arid ecosystems, this takes the form of providing soil nutrients and water (cite) or preventing excessive sunlight or physical damage from trampling and wind (cite). Nurse plants (or nurse rocks) provide these amenities to seedlings, and improve recruitment and germination in juvenile plants (cite). This makes nurse plants important facilitators for many species. Some of these patient plants are even obligated to be deposited under the canopy of a nurse plant to germinate at all. Therefore, the nurse plant is a limiting factor in the growth of many plant species. 

However, before a nurse plant can "offer its services" to a germinating seedling, the seed must arrive under the canopy of a nurse plant (cite: functioning of a nurse plant). Because plants are sessile lifeforms, the movement of seeds must rely of some abiotic or biotic vector of transportation (cite). The placement of of a seed after being deposited either through endozoochory, exozoochory, wind dispersal, or mechanical dispersal is known as seed rain (cite). A seed shadow, however, refers to the placement of daughter seeds relative to the mother plant (cite). There is much research in regards to the successful recruitment and germination of seed rain based on the nurse plant (cite) as well as the effects of the gut of endozoochorous dispersers on germination success (cite). However, there is little work done which has identified the relative importance of dispersers, particularly in arid ecosystems (cite). 

Frugivorous birds are known endozoochorous vectors of seed dispersal in many habitats (cite), however their importance as dispersers for members of the family Cactaceae (cacti) in arid environments is undocumented, particularly as it relates to their effectiveness of placing seeds in areas of facilitation. But what characteristics of a cacti might drive frugivory by birds? As allocation theory suggests, cacti have evolved to allocate energy and resources to anatomical features which best increase their fitness (cite). Fruit size/number and seed size/number are reproductive organ characteristcs which may determine fitness in plants. 

However, fruiting is also dependent on pollination, a service which birds (particularly hummingbirds) provide. According the the magnet hypothesis, pollinators are drawn to "showier" flowering displays, with number of flowers being an honest signal of sugar content (cite). However, size (specifically height) of plants are potentially another contributing factor to pollinator visitation, as higher flowers are more likely to be seen by flying pollinators (cite). If larger cacti have more flowers and produce more fruit, it may stand that pollinators are important for the cactus of interest to produce offspring. 

Cacti, which are both facilitators and facilitatees, may rely heavily on positive interactions with birds in order to reproduce. In these studies, we will identify the strength of birds as pollinators and as seed dispersers for different species and reproductive characteristics of cacti. These findings will increase our understanding of the importance in community-level positive plant-animal interactions in determining an ecosystem's biotic structure. 

##Study Sites

**Mojave Desert: Sweeney Granite Mountains Desert Reseach Center**
A preservation with use exclusive to researchers, the Mojave Desert Site (34.8056째N, 115.6639째W) is located in San Bernadino Country. It boasts a high diversity of 504 vascular plant, 156 birds, 42 mammals, and 2 amphibians. The site has an average of 23 cm of precipitation annually. The July maximum and minimum mean temperature of 33 degrees C and 20 degrees C, respectively, and a December maximum and minimum mean temperature of 8 degrees C and -1 degrees C, respectively. The elevation range is 1,128 to 2,071 meters. It is home to Buckhorn Cholla (*Cylindroputia acanthocarpa*) and Beavertail Prickly Pear (*Opuntia basilaris* var. *basilaris*). 

**Wind Wolves Preserve**
Self identifying as the West Coast's largest nonprofit preserve at 93,000 acres, the Wind Wolves Preserve (34.9943째N, 119.1854째W) is located within Kern County,  CA. The site's elevation ranges between 640 and 6,005 feet. The site is home to several endangered species, including the Bakersfield cactus (*Opuntia basilaris* var. *treleasei*). The preserve is dominated by invasive grasses, particularly Brome Grass (*Bromus* ssp.) with the management conducting studies to remove those invasives. 

**TBD Arizona Site**
We must conduct a team expedition to find suitable sites in the Sonoran Desert, where the Saguaro Cactus (*Carnegiea gigantea*) is found. 

#Study Species

_**Opuntia basilaris**_ var. _**basilaris**_, also known as Beavertail, is a frequently occurring species of the family Cactaceae. Found at 800-1900 meters above sea level in gravelly bajadas, washes, and pinyon-juniper woodland (a common habitat in the Granite Mountains) , this species is more easily accessible than some other *Opuntia* species [@Andre2016]. Like other members of the *Opuntia* genus, this species is distinct for its "paddle" shaped leaves and bright pink flowers. It is listed as secure by The Nature Conservancy.  

_**Cylindropuntia acanthocarpa**_, or Buckhorn Cholla, is another member of the Cactaceae family found in the Mojave desert and Granite Mountains. Found commonly in gravelly bajadas at 900-1500 meters above sea-level, it has similar accessibility as *O. basilaris* [@Andre2016]. With an appearance more like a small, spiky tree and large red flowers, the genus *Cyclindropuntia* was recently split from the *Opuntia* genus [@Nobel2002].

_**Opuntia basilaris**_ var. _**treleasei**_, or the Bakersfield Cactus, is a state and federally listed endangered variation of *Opuntia basilaris*. At the time of listing, it was considered its own species, *Opuntia treleasei* [@StateofCalifornia2018]. Like the *basilaris* variation, the *treleasei* is found in gravelly soil [@Hoover1970]. 

_**Carnegiea gigantea**_, commonly known as Saguaro, is a columnar cactus found in the Sonoran Desert. A distinctive species, it's large, white, waxy flowers bloom at the apex of the arms or spire of the plant. While they can live between 150-200 years, they are obligated to be facilitated by nurse plants. They also require wet environments for germination, a limiting factor in the American Southwest. (cite)


#Chapter 1: Fruiting metrics in Cactaceae: A meta-analysis

##Purpose
This meta-analysis will provide a comprehensive analysis of studies related to fruit and seeds of plants within the Cactaceae family. It will seek to synthesize reports on allocation theory. 

##Research Questions
1) Do larger cacti individuals within the same species produce more fruits and/or larger fruits?
2) Do larger cacti individuals within the same species produce more seeds and/or larger seeds?
3) Do larger fruits produce more seeds compared within the same species?

##Strategy of the systematic review
Using combinations of search terms in Web of Science, I will perform a systematic review of fruiting cacti and their size, isolating the relevant studies as data points for a meta-analysis through a series of filtering mechanisms (Fig 1). The search terms include different combinations of: "cact", "seed", "fruit", "allocat", and "size". To be included in the meta-analysis, papers must have been published in the past 5 years, be ecological in discipline, and report a regression or correlation coefficient.

##Progress to date
At this time, XX papers have been reviewed, with XX papers identified as fitting requirements prefaced above. Next steps include compiling the data points (regression and correlation coefficients), and summarize the pooled results of the relevant papers. 

#Chapter 2: Strength of birds as pollinators and seed dispersers in Cactaceae

##Purpose
This chapter will test the strength of pollinating/frugivorous bird interactions to observed and experimentally manipulated characteristics with and between 3 cacti species. 

##Research Questions
1. Is cactus size an indicator for fruit mass/abundance? For flower abundance? 
2. Is there a positive relationship between number of seeds per fruit and fruit size in the cacti of interest? 
3. Are frugivorous birds stronger disperers for larger cacti? 
4. Are pollinating birds (hummingbirds) optimally foraging at larger cacti?

##Hypotheses and Predictions
1. Cacti size and flower, fruit, and seed production are positively related. 
Predictions:
  + Larger cacti will produce more flowers, fruits, and seeds, as well as more massive fruits and seeds. 
  + This will be true within species, but not between species.
2. Fruit mass and seed abundance are positively related.
  + Larger individual fruits will have more seeds than smaller fruits.
3. Frugivorous and pollinating birds optimally forage at cacti.
Predictions:
  + Birds will more frequently pollinate larger cacti, which have more flowers.
  + Birds will more frequently eat fruit at larger cacti, which have larger/more fruits.

##Treatments
* **Mesohabitat**: Open/Cactus
  + *Open is the control for cactus presense*
* **Species of cactus**: *Opuntia basilaris* var. *basilaris*, *Opuntia basiliaris* var. *treleasei*, or *Cylindropuntia anthrocarpa*
* **Size of cactus individual**: Large, medium, small
* **Percentage of flower/fruit on cactus**: 0%, 50%, 100% 
  + *0% fruit on cactus is the negative control, 100% fruit on cactus is positive control for fruit abundance*

##Response variables
* Mass of individual fruits
* Mass of individual seeds
* Number of fruits per cactus
* Number of seeds per fruit
* Species richness and diversity per cactus 
* Proportion of frugivous birds present relative to non frugivorous birds

##Methods and Experimental Design

###Site specific metrics
For one week (4 days at the Mojave, 2 days at Wind Wolves), I will complete a preliminary field season where I measure the size of each cactus (x, y, and z dimensions of the cactus) and count its branches. I will do this for 100 individuals of each study species. I will also perform a density survey of cactus species. To do this, I will randomly choose one spot within my study site, and create a 100m transect starting from that point in a random direct. Every 5m, I will record the distance to the nearest cactus of each species. I will repeat this transect 6 times total, 10m a part for each "starting" point of the transect. This week will only be to collect data to ensure my sample size and timeframe is reasonable, so that I have ample time to redesign any issues in my methods. 

In addition to surveying cactus density and diversity, we will also be conducting density and diversity surveys of birds at the site. While walking 1km transects, we will record the presense and transect meter for all birds seen or heard, and identify them to the best of our ability. Doing this once every 7 days, this will give us a better idea of the total bird diversity/density of the site.

###Flowering Experiment
Pending the exploratory week, we will return in April/May during the flowering season to observe pollinating birds interactions with cacti. The cacti will have different levels of manipulated "showiness" (percent of flowers) at differnt sized cacti. First, we will choose 270 cacti (10 replicates of each combination of species, size, and percent flower), and remove 0%, 50%, and 100% of flower buds from 10 individuals of each size class and species. 

While the flowering season for our study cacti is in May, the cactus individual itself only blooms for 1-2 days throughout the season. Additionally, we are most interested in hummingbirds as pollinators, which are nearly impossible to document on camera traps and difficult to identify by eye (especially female/juveniles). Because of these constraints, we will primarily rely on focal observations aided by a 200-500mm digital camera. We will do 1 hour observations in mornings or evenings at each combination of variables 4 times (36 hours of observations).

We will also deploy 18 unidirectional audio recorders at 9 sites (2 recorders per site), with one recorder facing the cactus and one facing an open area in the opposite direction. The recorders will be 5m from the cactus of interest, and the open site will have no cacti within 5m of the recorded direction. 

###Fruiting Experiment
Next, in August, we will begin the fruiting observation and experiment--it will be nearly identical to the flowering experiment, but with some added components. Each combination of variables (species, size, and fruit percent) will again have 10 replicates, meaning 270 cacti will be a part of the study. We will remove 0%, 50%, and 100% of fruits from small, medium, and large cacti for all three species. We will immediately place each cactus's fruit in a sealed ziplock bag to prevent dessication while in the field. Post collection, we will weigh the fruits and seive the seeds for weighing and counting. 

We will place two camera traps at 1 sample cactus which contains all combinations of cactus treatments, one facing the cactus and one facing the open (18 total cameras). We will leave this camera to record movement for 5 days taking still images. After 5 days, we will randomly choose a new cactus/open site for each treatment combination to place camera traps at. Open spaces will be at least 1m distance from the corresponding cactus to avoid spatial autocorrelation (cite). We will replicate this process 5 times, over 25 days. Because camera traps may be unreliable recorders of bird abundance, we will also replicate this process with sound recorders placed under the cactus's canopy, and a corresponding recorder placed where there are no cacti (is this a pairing issue? hmm). Sound recorders have been shown to be a more reliable measurement of bird presense than walking transects, and are more time and cost effective (cite). 

In addition to passive monitoring, we wil also perform focal observations, equipped with 200-500mm digital cameras. We will be at least 10 meters from the cactus, so as not to impact bird abundance. These focal observations will last for 1 hour in mornings or evenings, and be performed 4 times at each combination of treatments (36 total hours of focal observation). We will record each bird individual's species and behavior (using an ethogram). Should there be more than one individual present, we will record the visiting species, but continue behavior observation for the first arrival birds (for up to 10 minutes, although this time limit is unlikely). 

We will give seeds taken from *Opuntia basilaris* var. *treleasei* to the management at the Wind Wolves Preserve, should they desire to use these seeds in restoration projects (as they do with many native species at the site). I will have a team of 4-6 undergraduate assistants to help me, particularly with fruit collection and focal observations.

##Paired Flower and Fruit Observations
Because the manipulated flowering and fruiting cacti will not be paired, we will also perform a paired observational study. To link flowering number to fruiting number, we will find 20 individuals of each species in flowering season, and count the number of flowers/buds, determine the branching pattern, and measure their volume (x, y, z axis). We will also measure the sugar content of the nectar for each plant. These cacti will be geographically logged, and revisited in the fruiting season. In August, we will similarly collect and count the number of fruit. These data will allow us to compare flowering patterns with fruiting patterns in paired individuals across species. 

#Chapter 3: Avian pollination and seed dispersal influence on seed shadow of Cactaceae obligatory facilitatees

##Purpose
This chapter will test the importance of birds as seed dispersers for cacti which are, at differnt life stages, beneficiaries and benefactors of nurse plants and animals respectively. Specifically, the Saguaro cactus. This chapter has nearly the same methods as Chapter 2, except an additional step to link birds to saguaro facilitators.

##Research Questions
1. Does flower number predict fruit number?
2. Do larger cacti produce more flowers/fruits, or higher mass fruits than smaller cacti?
3. Do larger fruits produce more seeds, or higher mass seeds than smaller fruits?
4. Are frugivorous birds more frequent at for larger cacti?
5. Are pollinating birds (hummingbirds) optimally foraging at larger cacti?
6. Do birds produce seed rain in favorable habitats for germinating seedlings (under a nurse shrub canopy)?

##Hypotheses
1. Cacti size and flower, fruit, and seed production are positively related. 
Predictions:
  + Larger cacti will produce more flowers, fruits, and seeds, as well as more massive fruits and seeds. 
2. Bird frugivory and pollination optimally forage at cacti.
Predictions:
  + Birds will more frequently pollinate larger cacti, which have more flowers.
  + Birds will more frequently eat fruit at larger cacti, which have larger/more fruits.
3. Frugivorous birds are perching in spaces for depositing seed rain in optimal germination habitats (under nurse plant shrubs).
Predictions:
  + Frugivorous birds will be found more often perching above nurse plant canopies than in open areas. 

##Treatments
* **Mesohabitat**: Open/Cactus
  + *Open is the control for cactus presense.*
* **Mesohabitat**: Open/Nurse Shrub
  + *Open is the control for nurse shrub presense.*
* **Size of cactus individual**: Large, medium, small
* **Percentage of fruit on cactus**: 0%, 50%, 100% 
  + *0% fruit on cactus is the negative control, 100% fruit on cactus is positive control for fruit abundance*

##Response variables
* Mass of individual fruits
* Mass of individual seeds
* Number of flowers per cactus
* Number of fruits per cactus
* Number of seeds per fruit
* Species richness and diversity per cactus/shrub
  + during both flowering and fruiting season
* Proportion of frugivorous birds present relative to other species per cactus
  + during both flowering and fruiting season
* Species richness and diversity per nurse shrub
* Proportion of frugivorous birds present relative to other species per nurse shrub

##Methods
All methods in regards to density, flowering, fruiting, and seed manipulations/measurements will be the same as in Chapter 2. Additionally, the methods to monitor bird species will also remain the same (camera trapping, audio recording, focal observations, and walking surveys). 

What will differ, however, is an additional component where we explore the saguaro's need to germinate under a nurse plant's canopy (cite). To do this, we will randomly select 100 shrub individuals, and count the number of Saguaro juveniles having germinated under the shrub canopy. We will then measure 100 paired open spaces 5m from a measured shrub. To determine bird abundance at these two sites, we will place 2 camera traps at 20 of the shrub/open sites (one camera facing the shrub, one facing the open), and 2 unidirectional audio recorders, one facing the shrub and one facing the open. We will only perform this protocol during the fruiting season.  

#Future Work 
This study opens up at least two side projects, potentially to be conducted by an undergraduate research assistant. One would be linking bird frugivory to seed shadow using seed trays placed under different mesohabitats. For example, the trays could be placed under nurse shrubs, cacti, and open spaces. This would help complete the circle of my thesis chapters. Additionally, by collecting fruit and seed samples, a collaborator could identify nutrition offered to bird species by facilitating cactus species. This would offer a better understanding of the importance of these cactus species to the community structure.
