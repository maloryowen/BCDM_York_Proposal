we need a paper about the semantics of positive interactions with an ontology



double mutualism - pollination and then seed dispersal



how do you decouple the different pathways?



can we do cacti density diversity differently?
revise methods slide

connect with Tarmo - or ask Jenna



refine - why research question - about cacti size?



fruit display - or cacti size - need to handle cacti size



assumption is that size matters but not necessarily a critical prediction

GUD - resource density versus risk versus costs? maybe do not invoke optimal foraging theory - flip the prediction and put birds first



cut cam traps for open sites focus on l,m,h (0,50,100) and defend it or expand removal numbers 0,25,50,75,100



should we control for cacti size or total fruit number?



focus more intensively on fruit-bird interactions



measure perch sites right after frugivory (optional)



make a trait table for the bird community
