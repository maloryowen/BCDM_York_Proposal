abstract = {We tested the relative frequency of pol- len limitation and dispersal limitation for two bird- pollinated and bird-dispersed New Zealand mistletoes, Peraxilla tetrapetala and Alepis flavida, at a South Island site where the bellbird (Anthornis melanura) is the sole pollinator and disperser. There was no evidence of dispersal limitation for P. tetrapetala over four seasons or A. flavida over two seasons. Few ripe fruits were present on plants at any one time (usually {\textless}5{\%}), and more than 90{\%} of the fruit crop was removed. A. flavida was not pollen limited, but P. tetrapetala was significantly pollen limited in 6 of 10 years. The presence of pollen limi- tation but not dispersal limitation, despite both serv- ices depending on the same bird, is influenced by the much faster rates of flower ripening per day com- pared with fruit ripening (15-54 times faster in P. tetrapetala). In New Zealand, pollination failure probably threatens at least as many plant species as dispersal failure. In theory, dispersal should threaten fewer plant species, because dispersal usually in- volves more animal species, makes smaller quanti- tative demands on the dispersers (fewer fruits ripening per day, and fruits can wait longer for at- tention), and may be less obligate for at least some reproduction to occur.},

abstract = {The dispersal, germination and establishment of the New Zealand Loranthaceae (Alepis flavida, Peraxilla colensoi, P. tetrapetala, Ileostylus micranthus and Tupeia antarctica) were investigated. The most important bird dispersers were tui, bellbirds and silvereyes. These birds appear to provide reasonably good quality dispersal: fruits were swallowed whole and the seeds later defecated in germinable condition; birds tended to visit plants for only 1-2 minutes and eat a few mistletoe fruits each time. Germinability of seeds ranged between species from moderate to high (17-96{\%}). None of the study species of mistletoe germinated successfully unless the fruit skin (exocarp) was removed, by hand or by passage through a bird gut. While hand removal of the exocarp gave the same or higher percentage germination as bird removal, in the field bird dispersal is the only effective method of exocarp removal and is therefore essential. Dispersal was limiting at one of three sites studied (Craigieburn), suggesting that reductions in bellbird densities by introduced carnivores or competition for honeydew food sources may be indirectly affecting mistletoe reproduction. Establishment and survival of seedlings on host branches was low (15-28{\%} depending on species to production of first independent leaves, 0-14{\%} after two years). Survival of adults over one year of the study was 80{\%} for Tupeia and 91-95{\%} in the other species, showing that frequent establishment of seedlings is necessary for population maintenance. While disperser limitation does not seem to currently be a major threat to mistletoe survival, it must be considered as a possible factor both historically and in the future.},

abstract = {Depletion of experimental seed patches by granivorous animals often is used as a qualitative assay of foraging activity. An optimal foraging model suggests that seed amounts remaining when foragers leave patches (``giving-up-density'', GUD) also provide quantitative measures of foraging economics, diet strategies and foraging abilities. Such quantitative uses of GUDs rest on several largely untested assumptions. We tested two of these with Merriam's kangaroo rats: that gain curves are smoothly decelerating, and that foragers leave patches at a constant harvest rate. Harvest rates indeed declined with patch residence time, but in the piecewise linear fashion expected of systematic search. Animals also revisited areas within patches less frequently than expected with random search. In the field, they depleted patches in multiple visits and did not use a constant-rate leaving rule. These deviations from model assumptions cast doubt on inferences about foraging ecology that have been based on quantitative GUD theory. Keywords},

abstract = {This review paper evaluates the potential of remote sensing for assessing species diversity, an increasingly urgent task. Existing studies of species distribution patterns using remote sensing can be essentially categorized into three types. The ?rst involves direct mapping of individual plants or associations of single species in relatively large, spatially contiguous units. The second tech- nique involves habitat mapping using remotely sensed data, and predictions of species distribution based on habitat requirements. Finally, establishment ofdirect relationships between spectral radiance values recorded from remote sensors and species distribution patterns recorded from ?eld observations may assist in assessing species diversity. Direct mapping is applicable over smaller extents, for detailed information on the distribution of certain canopy tree species or associ- ations. Estimations of relationships between spectral values and species distribu- tions may be useful for the limited purpose of indicating areas with higher levels of species diversity, and can be applied over spatial extents of hundreds of square kilometres. Habitat maps appear most capable of providing information on the distributions of large numbers of species in a wider variety of habitat types. This is strongly limited by variation in species composition, and best applied over limited spatial extents of tens of square kilometres},

Many traditional methods for monitoring can be infrequent and limited in scope. Ground-based LiDAR is one remote sensing method that offers a clear advancement to monitor vegetation dynamics at high spatial and temporal resolution. We determined the effectiveness of LiDAR to detect intra-annual variability in vegetation structure at a long-term Sonoran Desert monitoring plot dominated by cacti, deciduous and evergreen shrubs. Monthly repeat LiDAR scans of perennial plant canopies over the course of one year had high precision. LiDAR measurements of canopy height and area were accurate with respect to total station survey measurements of individual plants. We found an increase in the number of LiDAR vegetation returns following the wet North American Monsoon season.},

abstract = {Recent studies show that the mutualistic role of lizards as pollinators and seed dis- persers has been underestimated, with several ecological factors promoting such plant–animal interactions, especially on oceanic islands. Our aim is to provide a quan- titative assessment of pollination and seed dispersal mutualisms with lizards in conti- nental xeric habitats. We carried out focal observations of natural populations of Melocactus ernestii (Cactaceae) in the Caatinga, a Brazilian semiarid ecosystem, in order to record the frequency of visits, kind of resource searched and behaviour of vis- iting animals towards flowers and/or fruits. We made a new record of the lizard Tro- pidurus semitaeniatus foraging on flowers and fruits of M. ernestii. During the search for nectar, T. semitaeniatus contacted the reproductive structures of the flowers and transported pollen attached to its snout. Nectar production started at 14:00 h, with an average volume of 24.4 ll and an average concentration of solutes of 33{\%}. Approxi- mately 80{\%} of the seeds of M. ernestii found in the faeces of T. semitaeniatus germi- nated under natural conditions. The roles of T. semitaeniatus as pollinator and seed disperser for M. ernestii show a clear relationship of double mutualism between two endemic species, which may result from the environmental conditions to which both species are subject. Seasonality, low water availability and arthropod supply in the environment, high local lizard densities, continuous nectar production by the flower and fruits with juicy pulp may be influencing the visits and, consequently, pollination and seed dispersal by lizards in this cactus.

abstract = {Pollination syndromes (correlations between floral and pollinator traits), have long interested ecologists, but remain inadequately explained. For example, plant species pollinated by relatively large animals cannot have evolved correspondingly high rates of nectar-energy production simply because such animals need relatively more energy; evolution does not work that way. The inverse correlation between pollinator body-size and nectar concentration is similarly difficult to explain.To remedy this, I propose that Optimal Foraging Theory (OFT) and the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy approach (ESS) be combined and applied to pollination syndromes. Both hypothesise that, through evolution, average biological fitness of individuals has been maximised. OFT predicts foraging consequences for pollinators varying in body size, and other attributes, allowing the ESS approach to be applied to co-adapted plant-pollinator traits. This should lead to predicted relationships between plants and their pollinators.The steps involved in this process are conceptually straightforward, but empirically difficult, which may explain why the approach has been very little pursued in the past. However such difficulties can be overcome, thus pointing to the future.We surely need to understand pollination systems, in order to conserve and manage them. It is therefore time to reconnect OFT and plant-pollinator co-evolution, within the general ESS approach, and hence increasing our understanding of pollination syndromes and other plant-pollinator relationships.},

abstract = {While the effects of nectar robbing on plants are relatively well-studied, its impacts from the perspective of the pollinators of robbed plants is not. Numerous studies do consider the impacts of robbing on pollinator visitation to robbed plants, but rarely do they focus on its scaled-up impacts on individual pollinator behavior. We used radio telemetry to track the spatial and behavioral responses of the territorial hummingbird Aglaeactis cupripennis to experimental nectar robbing over a period of several days. Simulated nectar robbing impacted foraging behavior by increasing territory area, distance flown, and reliance on novel food resources, especially small-bodied flying insects. We did not observe any impact on the amount of time individuals spent foraging, nor did we observe territory abandonment. These findings indicate that nectar robbing may impose a significant energetic cost on pollinators via increased flight distances and shifts towards potentially less profitable food resources, and demonstrate the importance of quantifying the indirect effects of nectar robbing on pollinators in addition to plants.},

abstract = {Although our biological knowledge regarding cactus species is thorough in many areas, only in recent years have ecologists addressed their demographic behavior. Here we attempt a first review of the present knowledge on cactus demography, including an analysis of the published information on species with different growth forms and life-history traits. Our review shows that cactus distribution ranges are determined by environmental heterogeneity and by species-specific physiological requirements. Temperature extremes may pose latitudinal and altitudinal distribution limits. At a more local scale, soil properties dramatically affect cactus distribution. Most cacti show a clumped spatial distribution pattern, which may be the reflection of a patchy resource distribution within their heterogeneous environments. The association of cacti with nurse plants is another factor that may account for this aggregated distribution. Many cacti grow in association with these perennial nurse plants, particularly during early life-cycle phases. The shade provided by nurse plants results in reduced evapotranspiration and buffered temperatures, which enhance cactus germination and establishment. In some cases a certain degree of specificity has been detected between particular cactus species and certain nurse plants. Yet some globose cacti may establish in the absence of nurse plants. In these cases, rocks and other soil irregularities may facilitate germination and establishment. Cacti are slow-growing species. Several abiotic factors, such as water and nutrient availability, may affect their growth rate. Competition and positive associations (i.e., mycorrhizae and nurse-cacti association) may also affect growth rate. Age at first reproduction varies greatly in relation to plant longevity. In general, cactus reproductive capacity increases with plant size. Populations are often composed of an uneven number of individuals distributed in the different size categories. This type of population structure reflects massive but infrequent recruitment events, apparently associated with benign periods of abundant rainfall. A few cactus species have been analyzed through the use of population-projection matrices. A total of 17 matrices were compiled and compared. Most of them reflect populations that are close to the numerical equilibrium (lambda = close to unity). Elasticity analyses revealed that the persistence of individuals in their current size category ("stasis") is the demographic process that contributes the most to population growth rate. Also, adult categories (rather than juveniles or seedlings) show the largest contributions to lambda. No differences were apparent regarding this matter between cacti with different life-forms. This review shows that our knowledge of cactus population ecology is still incipient and rather unevenly distributed: some topics are well developed; for others the available information is still very limited. Our ability to preserve the great number of cactus species that are now endangered depends on our capacity to deepen our ecological understanding of their population processes.},

abstract = {Frugivory and seed dispersal are key processes for the maintenance of biodiversity. This is particularly true in the Neotropics, where most plant species depend on animals to disperse their seeds and most birds and mammals include fruits in their diets. We performed a continental-scale literature review to build a database of interactions between neotropical fruits and fruit-eating birds and mammals. Our objective was to evaluate the viability of combining literature data from different studies to describe the structure of highly diverse fruit–frugivore neotropical communities. We investigated sites that had been the focus of studies of at least four different avian and/or mammalian taxonomic orders and we included in our database only those conducted for at least a 6-month period in order to account for the seasonality in fruit availability. In spite of a large number of study sites investigated for frugivory (n = 156), we found a huge gap in the knowledge of community-wide fruit–frugivore interactions in the Neotropics, since most studies focused on single or a few species. Nevertheless, we were able to construct diverse plant–frugivore qualitative networks for 17 areas unevenly spread throughout the neotropical region. Using complex network analyses, we found that these networks were highly informative and non-randomly organized. Most networks were both significantly nested and modular, characteristics related to stability and resilience in biological systems. We concluded that it is possible to use merged data to build networks for sites of conservation interest. The main advantage of using this approach is to optimize resources, avoiding exhaustive, costly and time-consuming fieldwork when data is already available. Whilst bearing in mind the shortcomings of this methodology, these results can be used in studies aiming to understand the ecological processes structuring different communities in the neotropical region and to support conservation and restoration actions.

abstract = {1. While the relationship between facilitation and competition has been explored extensively in recent years, there is also a natural link between facilitation and mutualism, as both are interspecific interactions that confer benefits. Yet, the relationship between these two interactions has been minimally explored. 2. Here, I explore parallels and differences between mutualism and facilitation. Five focal areas organize current research on mutualism evolution: trait evolution; the continuum from specialization to generalization; the evolutionary origins and maintenance of the interaction; co-evolution of partners; and the prevalence and implications of cheating. These foci are also helpful for investigating how facilitation evolves, a much less explored issue. 3. Testable hypotheses regarding the evolution of facilitation include the following: selection should be stronger on traits of facilitated species than on traits of facilitators; facilitative interactions with mutualistic (++) and commensal (+0) outcomes should exhibit greater evolutionary stability than those with antagonistic (+2212) outcomes; co-evolution should be possible in mutualistic and antagonistic facilitation only; when co-evolution occurs, it should produce a geographic mosaic of interaction outcomes; and antagonistic facilitation could lead to selection on facilitators to either escape or to tolerate the neighbours that benefit from them. 4.Synthesis. Three gaps in our knowledge currently impede progress on evolutionary questions surrounding facilitation. First, reciprocal effects are rarely investigated; facilitation might evolve like mutualism, commensalism or antagonism, depending on effects on the facilitator species. Secondly, the genetics of relevant traits are not yet well explored; the traits themselves are better known for facilitator species than for the facilitated, which are more likely to evolve in the context of the interaction. Finally, the fitness costs and benefits associated with facilitation have rarely been measured. Filling these gaps should permit rapid progress in understanding how facilitation arises, persists and evolves.},

abstract = {Spatial genetic structure (SGS) of plants results from the nonrandom distribution of related individuals. SGS provides information on gene flow and spatial patterns of genetic diversity within populations. Seed dispersal creates the spatial template for plant distribution. Thus, in zoochorous plants, dispersal mode and disperser behaviour might have a strong impact on SGS. However, many studies only report the taxonomic group of seed dispersers, without further details. The recent increase in studies on SGS provides the opportunity to review findings and test for the influence of dispersal mode, taxonomic affiliation of dispersers and their behaviour. We compared the proportions of studies with SGS among groups and tested for differences in strength of SGS using Sp statistics. The presence of SGS differed among taxonomic groups, with reduced presence in plants dispersed by birds. Strength of SGS was instead significantly influenced by the behaviour of seed dispersal vectors, with higher SGS in plant species dispersed by animals with behavioural traits that result in short seed dispersal distances. We observed high variance in the strength of SGS in plants dispersed by animals that actively or passively accumulate seeds. Additionally, we found SGS was also affected by pollination and marker type used. Our study highlights the importance of vector behaviour on SGS even in the presence of variance created by other factors. Thus, more detailed information on the behaviour of seed dispersers would contribute to better understand which factors shape the spatial scale of gene flow in animal-dispersed plant species.},

abstract = {Cooperation is widespread both within and between species, but are intraspecific and interspecific cooperation fundamentally similar or qualitatively different phenomena? This review evaluates this question, necessary for a general understanding of the evolution of cooperation. First, we outline three advantages of cooperation relative to noncooperation (acquisition of otherwise inaccessible goods and services, more efficient acquisition of resources, and buffering against variability), and predict when individuals should cooperate with a conspecific versus a heterospecific partner to obtain these advantages. Second, we highlight five axes along which heterospecific and conspecific partners may differ: relatedness and fitness feedbacks, competition and resource use, resource-generation abilities, relative evolutionary rates, and asymmetric strategy sets and outside options. Along all of these axes, certain asymmetries between partners are more common in, but not exclusive to, cooperation between species, especially complementary resource use and production. We conclude that cooperation within and between species share many fundamental qualities, and that differences between the two systems are explained by the various asymmetries between partners. Consideration of the parallels between intra-and interspecific cooperation facilitates application of well-studied topics in one system to the other, such as direct benefits within species and kin-selected cooperation between species, generating promising directions for future research. K E Y W O R D S : Competition, cooperation, interspecific interactions, mutualism, social evolution. Cooperation occurs between conspecifics that often interact in social groups (Alexander 1974; Queller and Strassmann 2009; Bourke 2011), and between heterospecifics that interact in mu-tualisms (Bronstein 2015). Here, we use the term cooperation to refer to any interaction in which an actor confers a fitness benefit to another individual and receives an (inclusive) fitness benefit in return, since this is the key characteristic common to the many definitions in the literature (West et al. 2007). De-spite this shared characteristic, the evolution of cooperation has historically been studied separately in intra-specific and inter-specific systems with relatively minimal cross-talk between re-searchers in each field. Thus, the majority of work focuses ei-ther only on cooperation within species (e.g., Alexander 1974; Sherman et al. 1995; Lehmann and Keller 2006; Bergm{\"{u}}ller et al. 2007; Rodrigues and Kokko 2016) or only on coopera-tion between species (e.g., Herre et al. 1999; Bshary and Bron-stein 2004; Foster and Wenseleers 2006; Leigh 2010; Bronstein 2015).},

abstract = {Research on plant–animal interactions has been focused on direct consumer interactions (i.e. plants as resources), but non-trophic interactions including providing shelter or interference with movement can also affect the fine-scale distribution of animals. In particular, non-trophic interactions that are positive could support threatened animal populations. Positive interactions have been used in the restoration of plant communities, but have not yet been extended to the management of animal habitat. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that non-trophic interactions influence the occurrence of an endangered lizard species in an arid shrub-annual system. At a location known to have a population of blunt-nosed leopard lizards (Gambelia sila), we geotagged 700 shrubs, measured shrub morphometric traits, collected biomass samples, and surveyed for lizard presence using scat detection dogs over two years. Relative to 2014, in 2013 plant productivity was high and lizard scats were found more frequently in areas with low invasive grass cover (i.e. residual dry matter, RDM). In 2014, plant productivity was low because of an extreme drought year, and lizard scats were more frequently observed under shrub canopies, particularly those with relatively dense cover. These findings support the novel theory that positive non-trophic interactions are a critical form of plant–animal interactions in addition to consumption. Dominant shrubs can act as a foundation species by functioning as a basal node in structuring both plant and animal communities through a network of interactions. Managing dominant plants, in addition to habitat, is therefore important for conserving animal species in arid ecosystems.},

abstract = {Facilitation studies focus primarily on plants often neglecting the extended effects that cascade through ecological networks. Plants interact with other organisms through consumptive effects and a myriad of non-trophic effects such as habitat amelioration or pollination. Shrubs are a dominant benefactor species frequent in plant-facilitation studies but can also have direct and indirect interactions with animals. Herein, we use a systematic review to address the following two objectives: (i) to propose a conceptual framework that explores these interactions including the functional roles of the interacting species, and (ii) to quantitatively summarize the current state of this field examining effects beyond plant–plant interactions. To date, a relatively limited number of studies have examined the importance of coupled benefactor-subordinate plant positive interactions with animals (79 studies in total). From this set of studies, 36 studies documented positive plant interactions generating a total of 53 independent instances of either shrub–plant–animal or shrub–animal–plant interactions. These interaction pathways were evenly split between direct (49{\%}) and indirect (51{\%}) interactions of shrubs with animals. Hypotheses frequently tested included seed trapping, herbivore protection, magnet pollination and facilitation-mediated secondary seed dispersal. The most common functional role of shrubs was protection from herbivory, and the most common animal role associated with plant-facilitation complexes was that of a consumer. None of these studies explored bidirectional plant–animal interactions, used a network approach to describe the interaction sets, nor contrasted interaction strengths. Multitrophic, integrated sets of experiments incorporating plant facilitation into community dynamics are thus critical in advancing management of high-stress ecosystems wherein positive interactions are commonly reported.},

abstract = { Patterns of association of three columnar cactus species with potential nurse plants and rocks were examined in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Arizona. Close spatial associates of cacti are often called ???nurses??? because they provide a less extreme microclimate for cactus seedlings, which improves survival rates. Of the three cacti, Carnegiea gigantea had the greatest frequency of association with nurse plants. Stenocereus thurberi, which is common on steep hillslopes where rocks and crevices offer numerous protected microsites for seedling establishment, was associated with nurse rocks more frequently than were the other two species. Lophocereus schottii showed the lowest frequency of association with nurses. In the Monument, L. schottii reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, which reduces the need of small cacti for protection from nurses. Species most frequently associated with the three cacti were among the dominant species where each cactus occurred except that sparsely foliated species were associated with cacti less frequently than expected. This pattern supports previous claims that structural characteristics are more important than species identification in providing cacti with enhanced chances for survival. It also suggests that at a landscape scale, population dynamics of columnar cacti are more closely linked to patterns of overall vegetation change than to population fluctuations of a particular species that acts as a nurse.

abstract = {Foundation species create complex habitats in which associated organisms find refuge from biological and physical stress; these foundation spe-cies are thus fundamental to the structure and resilience of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. In the present article, we develop an approach to understanding foundation species' effects in communities that are maintained not by a single foundation species, as has been the focus of research to date, but by multiple, co-occurring foundation species. Using examples from diverse ecosystems, we illustrate the prevalence of multiple-foundation-species assemblages and hypothesize that the nature of foundation-species interactions has important consequences for community structure. We predict where positive and negative interactions among foundation species will occur and suggest that they organize communities hierarchically in nested or adjacent assemblages that underlie landscape-scale patterns in species distribution. Elucidating the predictable nature of foundation-species interactions may be key to understanding and managing the biodiversity and functioning of many ecosystems. facultative effects of a single dominant, structure-forming space holder have been investigated. In coastal soft-sediment habitats, for instance, extensive beds of the seagrass Thalas-sia testudinum can cover otherwise low-productivity sand flats occupied by algae. By reducing water flow, modify-ing the substrate, and impeding the foraging efficiency of mobile predators, seagrass beds facilitate the settlement of benthic invertebrates and enhance the survivorship and den-sity of prey species (Orth et al. 1984, Heck et al. 2003, Canion and Heck 2009). Similarly, along thousands of kilometers of Caribbean coastline, networks of red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) roots provide essential nursery habitat for juvenile snappers, grunts, barracuda, and other fishes and physically guard these populations from larger predators (Beck et al. 2001, Faunce and Serafy 2008). Consequently, the trophic dynamics associated with seagrass and mangrove commu-nities arise largely from the biogenic framework provided by foundation species, which suggests a hierarchical com-munity organization in which species and their interspecific interactions occur within a community that is itself estab-lished with the facilitation of a foundation species (Bruno and Bertness 2001). Field experiments in which the presence of foundation species was manipulated or their physical attributes mimicked have elucidated the mechanisms by E},

abstract = {1. Once neglected, the role of facilitative interactions in plant communities has received consider-able attention in the last two decades, and is now widely recognized. It is timely to consider the progress made by research in this field. 2. We review the development of plant facilitation research, focusing on the history of the field, the relationship between plant–plant interactions and environmental severity gradients, and attempts to integrate facilitation into mainstream ecological theory. We then consider future directions for facilitation research. 3. With respect to our fundamental understanding of plant facilitation, clarification of the relationship between interactions and environmental gradients is central for further progress, and necessitates the design and implementation of experiments that move beyond the clear limitations of previous studies. 4. There is substantial scope for exploring indirect facilitative effects in plant communities, including their impacts on diversity and evolution, and future studies should connect the degree of non-transitivity in plant competitive networks to community diversity and facilitative promotion of species coexistence, and explore how the role of indirect facilitation varies with environmental severity. 5. Certain ecological modelling approaches (e.g. individual-based modelling), although thus far largely neglected, provide highly useful tools for exploring these fundamental processes. 6. Evolutionary responses might result from facilitative interactions, and consideration of facilitation might lead to re-assessment of the evolution of plant growth forms. 7. Improved understanding of facilitation processes has direct relevance for the development of tools for ecosystem restoration, and for improving our understanding of the response of plant species and communities to environmental change drivers. 8. Attempts to apply our developing ecological knowledge would benefit from explicit recognition of the potential role of facilitative plant–plant interactions in the design and interpretation of studies from the fields of restoration and global change ecology. 9. Synthesis: Plant facilitation research provides new insights into classic ecological theory and pressing environmental issues. Awareness and understanding of facilitation should be part of the basic ecological knowledge of all plant ecologists.},

However, given the size of the Chihuahuan Desert, the ecosystem services value for the entire bioregion is likely considerable. The Chihuahuan Desert is facing numerous threats, including energy development and overuse of natural resources. Projected growth in oil, gas, and wind energy could further degrade the services provided by this region. The relatively low ecosystem services values for this desert environment also indicate that the widespread desertification occurring globally is causing large decreases in ecosystem services across many landscapes.},

abstract = {Experiments utilizing 3299 transplanted saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea [Engelm.] Britt. {\&} Rose) seedlings were conducted at the Saguaro National Monument, Tucson, Arizona. The multiple-factor tests were de- signed to determine the effect upon saguaro establishment of shade, irrigation, and soil source. Shade was essential to seedling survival; mortality among one group of 1200 unshaded plants reached 100{\%} in 1 year compared with 65{\%} mortality among an equal number of shaded plants. The most critical time for the seedlings was the dry, hot period just before the beginning of the summer rains in July. Irrigation did not enhance survival of seedlings growing under the most favorable combinations of shade and soil; rainfall alone provided adequate moisture. The effect of soil source on survival was possibly a function of soil-surface albedo; more seedlings died on the darker and, by inference, hotter soils. Insects killed as many as 20{\%} of the seedlings. These animals were considered as only one of many minor agents affecting saguaro seedling establishment. Saguaro populations, it was concluded, will be strongly influenced by forces which alter the number of shade-producing perennial plants with which the saguaro grows-forces like grazing and climatic change.

abstract = {Accurate, threat-specific alarm systems might play a role in the evolution of joint-nesting systems by offsetting the high costs associated with joint nesting. The smooth-billed ani, a joint-nesting cooperatively breeding bird, produces at least two distinct classes of vocal alarms. Anis give 'chlurp' calls in response to flying raptorial birds, and they give 'ahnee alarms' in response to terrestrial threats. We used acoustic playback to test free-living anis' responses to these alarm calls. Anis responded to chlurp playback by diving into vegetative cover or flying low along the grass and into cover. These behaviours are appropriate defensive responses to an aerial threat. Anis that perched in low vegetation or on the ground responded to ahnee alarms by flying up to higher perches, an appropriate response to a terrestrial threat. Thus, both calls elicited responses that were appropriate to evade predation in the contexts under which the alarms are typically given. We conclude that smooth-billed anis respond to both chlurp and ahnee alarm calls by taking evasive action consistent with aerial and terrestrial threats, respectively. Even in the absence of an actual threat, the calls alone are sufficient to elicit these responses. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a cooperatively breeding, joint-nesting species that uses a functionally referential alarm calling system. We hypothesize that direct benefits garnered from this sophisticated alarm system offset some of the fitness costs incurred by joint nesting. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Allocation to reproduction is often examined at the whole plant level from an allometric perspective; however, investment in reproduction is a hierarchical process which represents the integration of adjustments at different hierarchical levels. This essay review presents some key issues in reproductive allocation by examining problems of allocation at different hierarchical levels within plant. At the whole plant level, the application of 'Rensch's rule' to plants is discussed as a mechanism that might explain size differences in relation to gender in dioecious species. At branch level, the existence of vegetative branches may be explained by hypotheses on branch specialization and costs of reproduction. However, vegetative branches might also constitute an 'assurance' for reproduction in variable environments. At a lower hierarchical level, fruit abortion is a process widely observed in plants that impose limits to our capacity to estimate and develop general laws about reproductive allocation in plants. The question of whether fruit abortion can be used by the parent to produce a more homogeneous progeny that limits asymmetric competition among sibs is discussed. Finally, it seems that in some cases the allocation within seeds is in accordance with some predictions of kin selection theory. Most of these topics contain open questions that deserve further research.},

abstract = {The saguaro population in a 700-ha area at the Desert Laboratory on Tumamoc Hill, Tucson, Arizona, was censused in 1908, one year after livestock were excluded. In 1964, four 10-ha plots were established within the original area to determine the effect of slope aspect on plant growth and demography. The plots were recensused in 1970 and 1993. We developed a model for determining saguaro age, using the growth rates of over 3000 plants from 1964 to 1970. The model was verified with 1993 data. Changes in population size and the estimated age structures were then used to infer regeneration trends. Saguaro populations on all slope aspects nearly doubled since 1908. Yet, during the same period, relative abundances of saguaros remained higher on the south and east aspects than on the north and west aspects. Higher recruitment and survival of young plants rather than mortality of older ones are largely responsible for the differences between aspects. The estimated age structures show large, multi-decadal fluctuations in saguaro regeneration. Prior to 1908, populations on all slopes experienced an extended period of decline beginning around the late 1860s. The recent surge in recruitment began in the 1920s and peaked in the 1970s. Populations currently are again in decline. Better regeneration generally corresponds with relatively wet conditions, and poorer regeneration with drier conditions. However, extended periods of decline often included episodes of relatively wet conditions (e.g., from the 1860s to the 1920s), indicating that other climatic and biotic factors also determine recruitment success. Establishment may have been suppressed by colder winters, livestock grazing, and rock quarrying. This long-term study demonstrates that, despite low regeneration and population decline during much of the last two centuries, saguaros have persisted on Tumamoc Hill because of episodic surges in seedling establishment.

abstract = {This study samples 247 saguaros (Carnegiea gigantea) and their nurses in 30 populations in the northern Sonoran Desert to determine whether saguaros are randomly distributed beneath their nurses' canopies. Saguaro-nurse association patterns are compared across three nurse groups distinguished by canopy architecture characteristics (leguminous trees, small dense Ambrosia spp. shrubs, and the larger, open-canopied shrub Larrea tridentata). For all three nurse types, saguaros are significantly clustered near the center of their nurse's base. Clustering varies with nurse architecture, as saguaros are most tightly clumped under the most open-canopied species (L. tridentata), as more than 80{\%} of saguaros were under the innermost 10{\%} of L. tridentata's subcanopy area. Saguaros showed the least basal clustering about tree nurses, though not significantly less than Ambrosia spp. nurses. More saguaros establish under Ambrosia relative to its cover in sampled populations, while saguaros were underrepresented under L. tridentata. All analyses suggest that L. tridentata is an inferior nurse for saguaros. Different canopy architecture influences the extent of ground available to a nursed species to benefit from, for establishment and survival. While herbivory, rodents or other factors may play a role in these patterns, ultimately microclimate differences are the most likely factor shaping cacti-nurse associations in the harsh desert environment. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The individualistic nature of communities is held as a fundamental ecological tenet by many ecologists. The empirical rationale for the individualistic hypothesis is largely based on gradient analyses in which plant species are almost always found to be arranged independently of one another in "continua" along environmental gradients. However, continua are correlative patterns and do not identify the processes that determine them. and so they do not necessarily preclude the possibility of interdependent interactions within plant communities. For example, the common occurrence of positive interactions suggests that plant species may not always be distributed independently of each other. If the distributions and abundances of species are enhanced by the presence of other species, their organization is not merely a coincidence of similar adaptation to the abiotic environment. Interpretations of gradient analyses also appear to assume that interactions among species should be similar at all points along environmental axes, and that groups of species should be associated at all points on a gradient if interdependence is to be accepted. However, virtually all types of ecological interactions have been shown to vary with changes in the abiotic environment, and a number of field experiments indicate that positive effects become stronger as abiotic stress increases. Furthermore, interactions among plants have been shown to shift from competition to facilitation along environmental continua. Thus, significant interdependence may occur even when species do not fully overlap in distribution. Higher-order, indirect interactions between animals and plants, and among plants, also suggest that interdependence within communities occurs. Eliminating a species involved in an indirect interaction may not necessarily mean that its beneficiary will be eliminated from a community, but the prospect that the distribution and abundance of any species in a plant community may be positively affected by the effects that other species have on their competitors suggests that communities are organized by much more than "the fluctuating and fortuitous immigration of plants and an equally fluctuating and variable environment" as stated by Henry Gleason. The ubiquity of direct and indirect positive interactions within plant communities provides a strong argument that communities are more interdependent than current theories allow},

abstract = {Positive interactions often play an important role in structuring plant communities and increasing biological diversity. Using three scales of resolution, we examine the importance of a long-lived desert tree, iron-wood (Olneya tesota), in structuring plant communities and promoting biological diversity in the Sonoran Desert. We examined the positive effects of Olneya canopies of different sizes on plant communities in mesic and xeric habitats throughout the central Gulf Coast subregion of Sonora, Mexico. In xeric sites, Olneya canopies had strong positive effects on plant richness and abundance, and small positive effects on the size of plants, underscoring the role of facilitation in extreme environments. In mesic sites, Olneya canopies had very little effect on perennials and a negative effect on ephemeral richness, suggesting predominantly competitive effects in this less stressful environment. Overall, Olneya canopies increased biological diversity where abiotic stress was high, but did not increase diversity in more mesic areas. Thus Olneya canopies caused consistent shifts in plant-community structure among xeric and mesic sites, but not when these landscapes were combined. Benefactor size also mediated positive interactions, with larger Olneya canopies supporting larger perennials in both xeric and mesic sites. Thus stress gradients and benefactor size both influenced the balance of facilitative and competitive effects under nurse-plant canopies, and the spatial scale at which facilitative effects shape community structure.},

abstract = {Question: Positive interactions are predicted to be common in communities developing under high physical stress or high herbivory pressure due to neighbour amelioration of limiting physical and consumer stresses, respectively. However, when both stress sources meet in the same community, the relative importance of the two facilitation mechanisms is poorly un - derstood. We ask: What is the relative importance of abiotic vs. biotic mechanisms of facilitation of tree saplings by shrubs in Mediterranean mountain forests? Location: Sierra Nevada, SE Spain (1800-1850 m a.s.l.) Methods: Saplings of four tree taxa ( Acer opalus ssp. grana­ tense , Quercus ilex , Pinus nigra ssp. salzmanii and P. sylvestris var. nevadensis ) were planted following a 2 × 2 factorial design: two levels of herbivory (control and ungulate exclusion) and two microhabitats (under shrubs and in open areas). Sapling survival and growth were monitored for five years. Results: Shrubs had positive effects on sapling survival both in control and ungulate excluded plots. This effect was species- specific, with shrubs increasing the survival of Acer opalus and Quercus ilex three and twofold, respectively, but having a minor effect on the Pinus species. Herbivory damage was also species-specific, being much higher for Acer opalus than for any other species. Shrubs did not protect saplings of any species against ungulates. Thus, all Acer saplings (the most damaged species) suffered herbivory outside the exclosures, which largely reduced sapling height. Conclusions: Protection from abiotic stress (summer drought and winter frost) was much more relevant than protection from biotic stress (herbivory). However, we propose that the final balance between the two mechanisms can be expected to vary strongly between sites, depending on the relative magnitude of the different sources of stress and the intrinsic traits (e.g. palatability) of the species interacting},

abstract = {1. The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts that the frequency of facilitative and competitive interactions will vary inversely across abiotic stress gradients, with facilitation being more common in conditions of high abiotic stress relative to more benign abiotic conditions. With notable exceptions, most tests of the SGH have studied the interaction between a single pair or a few pairs of species, and thus have evaluated shifts in the magnitude and direction of pair-wise interactions along stress gradients, rather than shifts in the general frequency of interactions. 2. The SGH has been supported by numerous studies in many ecosystems, has provided a crucial foundation for studying the interplay between facilitation and competition in plant communities, and has a high heuristic value. However, recent empirical research indicates that factors like the variation among species and the nature of the stress gradient studied add complexity not considered in the SGH, creating an opportunity to extend the SGH's general conceptual framework. 3. We suggest that one approach for extending the SGH framework is to differentiate between the original idea of how ‘common' interactions might be along stress gradients and the ubiquitous empirical approach of studying shifts in the strength of pair-wise interactions. Furthermore, by explicitly considering the life history of the interacting species (relative tolerance to stress vs. competitive ability) and the characteristics of the stress factor (resource vs. non-resource) we may be able to greatly refine specific predictions relevant to the SGH. 4. We propose that the general pattern predicted by the SGH would hold more frequently for some combinations of life histories and stress factor, particularly when the benefactor and beneficiary species are mostly competitive and stress-tolerant, respectively. However, we also predict that other combinations are likely to yield different results. For example, the effect of neighbours can be negative at both ends of the stress gradient when both interacting species have similar ‘competitive' or ‘stress-tolerant' life histories and the abiotic stress gradient is driven by a resource (e.g. water). 5. Synthesis. The extension of the SGH presented here provides specific and testable hypotheses to foster research and helps to reconcile potential discrepancies among previous studies. It represents an important step in incorporating the complexity and species-specificity of potential outcomes into models and theories addressing how plant–plant interactions change along stress gradients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Facilitation among plants in water-limited environments (i.e. where evapotranspiration overcomes the availability of water during the growing season) has been considered a local adaptation to water and light conditions. Among cacti, early life-history stages can benefit from the facilitative effects of nurse plants that reduce solar radiation and water stress. However, whether light condition itself acts as an agent of selection through facilitation remains untested. The aim of this study was to determine (1) whether light conditions affect seedling recruitment, (2) whether the positive effect of shade on seedling recruitment is more intense under more stressful conditions and (3) whether shade condition (facilitation) reduces the magnitude of local adaptation on seedling recruitment relative to full sunlight conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A reciprocal transplant experiment, coupled with the artificial manipulation of sun/shade conditions, was performed to test for the effects of local adaptation on germination, seedling survival and growth, using two demes of the columnar cactus Pilosocereus leucocephalus, representing different intensities of stressful conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: Full sunlight conditions reduced recruitment success and supported the expectation of lower recruitment in more stressful environments. Significant local adaptation was mainly detected under full sunlight conditions, indicating that this environmental factor acts as an agent of selection at both sites.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results supported the expectation that the magnitude of local adaptation, driven by the effects of facilitative nurse plants, is less intense under reduced stressful conditions. This study is the first to demonstrate that sun/shade conditions act as a selective agent accounting for local adaptation in water-limited environments, and that facilitation provided by nurse plants in these environments can attenuate the patterns of local adaptation among plants benefiting from the nurse effect.},

L. tridentata canopy and from open space).An observational study revealed that sexual establishment was very limited (only 8 juveniles/ha were found), while clonal establishment was more frequent (59 juveniles/ha); both types of propagule were found only under shrub canopy.Field experiments showed that, as in other .

Faster growth under canopy shade provides better chances of successful recruitment to later life-cycle stages. Stem segments never established in open space, requiring the shade of nurse plants. This may be due to physiological constraints imposed by their small volume. In synthesis, the results indicate that clonal propagation is the most important recruitment mechanism in .

The overall effect of gut treatment on seed germination percentage was significantly positive (mean effect size lnOR=0.29; 95{\%} CI: (0.27-0.31)). A similar value was found when meta-analysis was carried out at the study level (lnOR=0.25; (0.23-0.72)), which avoids pseudo-replication effects. The heterogeneity test of Qt was highly significant (P{\textless}0.00001), implying that other variables (predictors) account for some of the variation among studies. It is suggested that seed passage through the gut of a vertebrate can probably break only seed coat dormancy (functional dormancy) and not physiological (internal or embryological) dormancy, as difference in germination rate between ingested and uningested seeds are usually only a few days and more rarely a few weeks.},

abstract = {t. The nectar secreted by hummingbird-pollinated flowers is rich in sucrose, whereas nectar secreted by passerine-pollinated plants contains a mixture of glucose and fructose. To test the hypothesis that sugar preferences and nectar composition are correlated, I examined the sugar preferences of three species of Mexican hummingbirds (Amazilia rutila, Cynanthus latirostris, and Chlorostilbon canivetii). As predicted, the three species preferred sucrose over glucose, fructose, and a mixture of glucose and fructose (hexose mixture) in paired preference tests. Preferences for simple sugars were ranked as: sucrose {\textgreater} hexose mixture {\textgreater} glucose {\textgreater} fructose. The preference of hummingbirds for sucrose was not reversed by feeding hummingbirds a hexose mixture as a sole diet for 20 days. The preferences of hummingbirds for different sugars are puzzling because sucrose, glucose, and fructose have approximately the same energetic content. I hypothesized that sugar preferences were correlated with differences in the efficiency with which hummingbirds assimilated different sugars and/or in the time they required to process these sugars in the digestive system. Sucrose, glucose, and fructose, however, were assimilated by hummingbirds with equally high efficiency ({\textgreater} 97{\%}). Glucose solutions were processed by hummingbirds at a slower rate than hexose mixtures and sucrose solutions, and hence, were less profitable. Sucrose and hexose mixtures were processed at the same rate and therefore had the same profitability. Therefore, the preference of hummingbirds for sucrose over hexose mixtures cannot be explained by differences in assimilation efficiency or digestive handling time. Sucrose must be hydrolyzed into its monosaccharide components, glucose and fructose, before it can be absorbed in the intestine and used as an energy source. Relative to other birds, hummingbirds exhibit highly specialized digestive traits, such as very high rates of intestinal sucrose hydrolysis and glucose transport, which allow them to use sucrose as efficiently as mixtures of glucose and fructose. Many passerine species, in contrast, use the more easily absorbed monosaccharides, glucose and fructose, more efficiently than sucrose. The distribution of nectar sugars among bird-pollinated plants seems to be the result of the evolutionary response of plants to two sets of pollinators with different degrees of digestive specialization.

abstract = {Abstract The saguaro cactus, an icon of the American southwestern desert, defines the extent of the Sonoran Desert through portions of its range. Saguaros rely upon nurse plants for establishment and survival in the harsh temperature and moisture regime of the desert. Freezing temperatures limit the range of the saguaro to the north in Arizona. However, nurse plants extend the range of saguaros by providing more moderate conditions beneath their canopies. This study focuses on precisely these small, highly localized temperature variations, which, we suggest, are linked to regional-scale patterns of distribution of the species, particularly in marginal, cold-limited locales. We sampled 291 saguaros over thirty populations in Arizona, in the northern portion of their range. Saguaros establish under the south side of their nurse's canopy in the coldest parts of their range more often than expected, while a significant distributional bias is not observed in those in warmer, more moderate plots.

abstract = {Casual observations suggest that saguaro populations are densest in southeastern Arizona, although data have not been collected and no study has been done to address this topic. In addition, the topic of reproductive density has similarly never been addressed. Saguaro reproductive output is directly related to the number of adult individuals and the number of branches in the area. Thirty saguaro populations over their U.S. range were sampled to consider two variables: population density and reproductive stem density. Stepwise regression using climate and vegetation (e.g., availability of nurse plants) to predict density yielded tree + Ambrosia cover and maximum July precipitation. Nurse cover, however, is also influenced by summer rain. The partial correlation results suggest that high saguaro densities are linked with high quality nurse cover (i.e., not Larrea tridentata) in addition to summer rainfall. Total cover and mean annual precipitation are the best predictors of reproductive stem density. Mean annual precipitation may be a good predictor of reproductive stem density, because population density is linked with summer rain while branching is linked with winter rain. The plots were also divided into climatic regions. One-way ANOVA shows that the northeast (high winter precipitation) and west (dry) have lower saguaro densities than the southeast (high summer precipitation), while the northeast and southeast both have very high reproductive stem densities relative to the west. The warmer west is less susceptible to periodic freezing mortality, while previous work has shown that the southeast generally regenerates more successfully. Thus in the colder northeast, which is also outside of the primary summer rain and best nurse plant belt, low density populations seem to be maintained only with high reproductive density.},

Using data presently available in the literature, I compare the slopes (on a log-linear scale) of seed shadows for plants with different morphologically characterized modes of dispersal. The seeds of many species have no evident morphological adaptation for dispersal and seem to achieve only short-distance dispersal. Seed shad- ows for herbaceous species with devices for wind have flatter slopes and more distant modes and maxima than those of ballists, which in turn exceed those with no special devices. Seed shadows for wind- dispersed trees and shrubs had similar or steeper slopes than those for vertebrate-dispersed species in this sample. Species with poor mechanisms for dispersal in space only sometimes had the capacity for better dispersal in time (dormancy). Although some species exhibited seed shadows sufficiently steep to be predicted to colonize new habitat in a 'front' or phalanx pattern, actual colonization patterns must reflect many other factors.},

The conclusions obtained in the meta-analytical and phylogenetical approaches are very different. The meta-analysis revealed that the positive effects that gut passage had on seed germination increased with seed size in the case of gut passage through birds whereas decreased in the case of gut passage through non-flying mammals. However, once the phylogenetic relatedness among plant species was taken into account, the effects of gut passage on seed germination did not depend on seed size and were similar between birds and non-flying mammals. Some methodological considerations are given to improve the bridge between the meta-analysis and the comparative method.},

abstract = {Altered precipitation patterns resulting from climate change will have particularly significant consequences in water-limited ecosystems, such as arid to semi-arid ecosystems, where discontinuous inputs of water control biological processes. Given that these ecosystems cover more than a third of Earth's terrestrial surface, it is important to understand how they respond to such alterations. Altered water availability may impact both aboveground and belowground communities and the interactions between these, with potential impacts on ecosystem functioning; however, most studies to date have focused exclusively on vegetation responses to altered precipitation regimes. To synthesize our understanding of potential climate change impacts on dryland ecosystems, we present here a review of current literature that reports the effects of precipitation events and altered precipitation regimes on belowground biota and biogeochemical cycling. Increased precipitation generally increases microbial biomass and fungal:bacterial ratio. Few studies report responses to reduced precipitation but the effects likely counter those of increased precipitation. Altered precipitation regimes have also been found to alter microbial community composition but broader generalizations are difficult to make. Changes in event size and frequency influences invertebrate activity and density with cascading impacts on the soil food web, which will likely impact carbon and nutrient pools. The long-term implications for biogeochemical cycling are inconclusive but several studies suggest that increased aridity may cause decoupling of carbon and nutrient cycling. We propose a new conceptual framework that incorporates hierarchical biotic responses to individual precipitation events more explicitly, including moderation of microbial activity and biomass by invertebrate grazing, and use this framework to make some predictions on impacts of altered precipitation regimes in terms of event size and frequency as well as mean annual precipitation. While our understanding of dryland ecosystems is improving, there is still a great need for longer term in situ manipulations of precipitation regime to test our model.},

A recent increase in solar energy systems, especially large, centralized installations, underscores the urgency of understanding their environmental interactions. Synthesizing literature across numerous disciplines, we review direct and indirect environmental impacts - both beneficial and adverse - of utility-scale solar energy (USSE) development, including impacts on biodiversity, land-use and land-cover change, soils, water resources, and human health. Additionally, we review feedbacks between USSE infrastructure and land-atmosphere interactions and the potential for USSE systems to mitigate climate change. Several characteristics and development strategies of USSE systems have low environmental impacts relative to other energy systems, including other renewables. We show opportunities to increase USSE environmental co-benefits, the permitting and regulatory constraints and opportunities of USSE, and highlight future research directions to better understand the nexus between USSE and the environment. Increasing the environmental compatibility of USSE systems will maximize the efficacy of this key renewable energy source in mitigating climatic and global environmental change. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Reliable plans for desert bird conservation will depend on accurate prediction of habitat change effects on their distribution and abundance patterns. Predictive models can help highlight relationships between human-related and other environ- mental variables and the presence of desert bird species. Presence/absence of 30 desert bird species of Baja California peninsula was modelled on the basis of explanatory variables taken from the field, maps, and digital imagery. Generalized linear models were fit to each bird species using both variables representing human activity and other environmental factors as predictors that might influence distribution. Probability of species presence was used as a habitat suitability index to evaluate the effect of human activity when the model contained a significant human activity variable. No differences were found in bird species richness between natural sites and those transformed by agriculture or urbanization. Of 59 bird species recorded in surveys, 34{\%} were positively or negatively associated with human-transformed habitats. Fourteen species seem to benefit from transformation of natural vegetation by agriculture or urbanization, while six were negatively affected. Sensitivity analyses of final models indicated all were robust. Results suggest that the occurrence of a large percentage of bird species inhabiting scrub habitats is sensitive to human habitat transformation. This finding has important conservation implications at regional scale as fragmentation and conversion of desert ecosystems into agricultural and urban areas affect the distribution of species that are highly selective for scrub habitat. Land use and anthropogenic activities seem to change ecological patterns at large spatial scales, but other factors could drive species richness distribution too (i.e. individual species response, species–energy relationships). The spatial modelling approach at regional scale used in this study can be useful for designing natural resource management plans in the Sonoran desert scrub.},

However, the call-based acoustic communication systems of non-passerines have received less attention from investigators than those of passerines. We examined the vocal repertoire of Smooth-billed Anis (Crotophaga ani), cooperatively breeding cuckoos that live in groups with multiple breeding pairs. We recorded calls from 22 groups over two breeding seasons at the Cabo Rojo National Wildlife Refuge in Puerto Rico. We identified 11 call types and one group vocalization, and used an automated sound measurement program to quantify their acoustic features. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) correctly classified 74.2{\%} of calls based on these features. The vocal repertoire of Smooth-billed Anis is larger than that reported for the three other species in the subfamily Crotophaginae. Smooth-billed Anis have at least two alarm calls, two nest-specific calls, and one nest defense call. We also identified one possible signal of aggressive intent, one possible appeasement signal, and two calls that may communicate identity. The relatively large vocal repertoire of Smooth-billed Anis and association of distinct call types with different functions and contexts supports the main prediction of the social complexity hypothesis, i.e., species with more complex social systems will have more complex communication systems.},

Global climate change is expected to increase both the frequency and the intensity of climate extremes and there is an urgent need to understand their ecological consequences. 2.Major challenges for advancing our understanding of the ecological consequences of climate extremes include setting a climatic baseline to facilitate the statistical determination of when climate conditions are extreme, having sufficient knowledge of ecological systems so that extreme ecological responses can be identified, and finally, being able to attribute a climate extreme as the driver of an extreme ecological response, defined as an extreme climatic event (ECE). 3.The papers in this issue represent a cross-section of the emerging field of climate extremes research, including an examination of the palaeo-ecological record to assess patterns and drivers of extreme ecological responses in the late Quaternary, experiments in grasslands assessing a range of ecological responses and the role of ecotypic variation in determining responses to climate extremes, and the quantification of the ecological consequences of a recent ECE in the desert Southwest of the USA. 4.Synthesis. The papers in this Special Feature suggest that although the occurrence of ECEs may be common in palaeo-ecological and observational studies, studies in which climate extremes have been experimentally imposed often do not result in ecological responses outside the bounds of normal variability of a system. Thus, ECEs occur much less frequently than their potential drivers and even less frequently than observational studies suggest. Future research is needed to identify the types and time-scales of climate extremes that result in ECEs, the potential for interactions among different types of climate changes and extremes, and the role of genetic, species and trait diversity in determining ecological responses and their evolutionary consequences. These research priorities require the development of alternative research approaches to impose realistic climate extremes on a broad range of organisms and ecosystems.},

We quantify transient changes in daily-scale seasonal extreme precipitation events over the U.S. using a five-member ensemble of nested, high-resolution climate model simulations covering the 21st century in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario. We find a strong drying trend in annual and seasonal precipitation over the Southwest in autumn, winter, and spring and over the central U.S. in summer. These changes are accompanied by statistically significant increases in dry-day frequency and dry-spell lengths. Our results also show substantial increases in the frequency of extreme wet events over the northwestern U.S. in autumn, winter, and spring and the eastern U.S. in spring and summer. In addition, the average precipitation intensity increases relative to the extreme precipitation intensity in all seasons and most regions, with the exception of the Southeast. Further, most regions receive a greater fraction of total seasonal precipitation from extreme events. These results imply fewer but heavier precipitation events in the future, leading to more frequent wet and dry extremes in most regions of the U.S. Our simulations suggest that many of these changes are likely to become statistically significant by the mid-21st century. Given current vulnerabilities, such changes in extreme precipitation could be expected to increase stress on water resources in many areas of the U.S., including during the near-term decades.},

abstract = {Linking diversity to biological processes is central for developing informed and effective conservation decisions. Unfortunately, observable patterns provide only a proportion of the information necessary for fully understanding the mechanisms and processes acting upon a particular population or community. Here, we suggest conservation managers utilise the often overlooked information imbedded in species absences, paying particular attention to the dark diversity (i.e. a set of species that are absent from a site but can potentially disperse to and establish there, in other words, the absent portion of a habitat-specific species pool). Together with existing ecological metrics, concepts and conservation tools, dark diversity can be used to complement and further develop conservation prioritisation and management decisions through an understanding of biodiversity relativized by its potential (i.e. its species pool). Furthermore, through a detailed understanding of the population, community and functional dark diversity, the restoration potential of degraded habitats can be more rigorously assessed further, and so to, the likelihood of successful species invasions. We suggest the application of the dark diversity concept is currently an underappreciated source of information that is valuable for conservation applications ranging from macro-scale conservation prioritization to more locally-scaled restoration ecology and the management of invasive species.

Because successful seedling establishment occurs only beneath the canopies of shrubs and trees, we hypothesized that seed dispersal is a key process in the maintenance of its populations. We determined the dispersal effectiveness of different frugivores, con- sidering the quantity and quality components of seed dispersal. We also evaluated the potential effects of each frugivore species on the finite rate of increase of N. tetetzo pop- ulations by modifying the fecundity values of a Lefkovitch matrix model. The bat Lepto- nycteris curasoae had the highest effectiveness whereas the bird Carpodacus mexicanus had the lowest. The estimated finite rates of increase calculated to evaluate the effects of frugivores on the population dynamics of the cactus differ marginally from unity, except when the effect of the bat L. curasoae was analyzed. Our results suggest that the bat Leptonycteris curasoae could be considered the legitimate dispersal agent of N. tetetzo, dispersing seeds directly to safe sites, and thus representing a key species in the ecology of this columnar cactus.

abstract = {For animal species inhabiting patchy environments, the search behavior of individuals and the distance from which they can detect suitable habitat (perceptual range) are key determinants of the functional connectivity of landscapes. We examined the movement behavior and perceptual range of adult cactus bugs (Chelinidea vittiger), which are habitat specialists that feed and reproduce on Opuntia cactus. Movement pathways of walking individuals released into unsuitable matrix habitat (30-3000 m from Opuntia) were highly directional. These results supported predictions of optimal search behavior from published simulation models. A release experiment within natural patch networks indicated that the perceptual range of C. vittiger depended on size of the target patch, matrix structure, and direction of the target patch relative to prevailing winds. A strong effect of wind direction on orientation behavior (and presumed perceptual range) was evident in a release experiment using 'artificial' patches of potted Opuntia. In these two experiments, individuals released 50-100 cm from Opuntia patches were more likely to orientate toward patches located upwind than to those located crosswind or downwind. A reexamination of the pathways of individuals walking in the matrix also revealed a strong bias for movement upwind. Such upwind movement by individuals, both within and outside of patch networks, suggests that C. vittiger uses olfaction to navigate and it complicates our ability to interpret search behavior and to estimate perceptual range. Current techniques for assessing perceptual range have limitations for olfactory-based species. Furthermore, we need to broaden our view of perceptual range and of patch and landscape connectivity. Perceptual range may be anisotropic and connectivity may be directional. An organism-based approach to spatial ecology requires that we consider the dominant senses used by species when navigating around patchy landscapes.},

abstract = {1 Patterns of seed germination of grass and forb species were studied in open. Prosopis woodland of the central Monte desert (Argentina) during several years, to test the hypotheses that (i) seed germination is positively affected by both rainfall and protection afforded by vegetation cover (a facilitative effect), (ii) the number of surviving plants is positively in¯uenced by rainfall but negatively a€ected by established vegetation (a competitive effect), and (iii) seed loss from soil banks owing to germination is lower than that caused by granivorous animals. 2 Forb species germinated during restricted periods, either in early autumn or in spring. Grasses, however, germinated throughout the growing season, but because seedlings could not be identifed to species level, it was impossible to discern whether different species germinated in particular seasons, or if all grasses germinated in all seasons. Grass and forb germination were generally of similar magnitude, but grass germination increased by an order of magnitude during a summer of unusually abundant rainfall related to an El Ni{\~{n}}o o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. 3 Overall, the spatial distribution of neither germinating seeds nor surviving plants could be explained by interactions with established vegetation (facilitation and competition effects, respectively). An alternative explanation may be provided by the distribution of forb and grass seeds in the soil. 4 Seed loss owing to germination was low in both dry and rainy years. For forbs, such loss totalled {\textless}1{\%} of soil-seed reserves, and no forb species suffered losses {\textgreater}4{\%}. Total grass-seed loss to germination was usually {\textless}0.5{\%}, and the 5{\%} reached in 1997±98 corresponded to an interruption of a prolonged drought by unusually abundant rainfall associated with a reduced seed bank. 5 Grass-seed loss caused by germination was one to two orders of magnitude lower than that reported due to autumn-winter granivory in the central Monte desert.},

abstract = {Succulent CAM plants, such as columnar cacti, are important physiognomic elements of many arid lands. Although, these plans are often ecologically important because they provide abundant resources in the form of nectar and fruit, their contribution to the energy, nutrient and water budgets of consumes has not been quantified. We describe an isotopic approach that allows quantifying the ecological importance of CAM succulents. We first briefly review our work on the interaction between saguaros, an archetypical CAM succulent, and the desert doves that feed on its fruit. We then describe the potential importance of saguaro fruit as a function of its abundance, macronutrient composition, and seasonal availability. We argue that the resources provided by saguaros do much to satisfy the energy and water requirements of the birds that reside in hot subtropical deserts during the summer. We then describe the carbon isotope composition of saguaros and of the plant community in which they are imbedded and use two species of desert doves to illustrate how stable isotopes can reveal the importance of a single plant as a source of carbon and water for consumers. The second section of this review presents new data on the importance of saguaros for the entire community of birds that inhabit the Sonoran Desert during the summer. We show how the resources of saguaro reach across dietary guilds and account for a large proportion of the diet of many insectivorous species as well as that of granivorous and frugivorous species. We demonstrate that many of these species probably obtain significant water as well as nutrients from saguaro fruit. Finally, we point out the current limitations of using deuterium as a water tracer in animal systems.},

abstract = {Granivorous animals can exert major effects on the abundance and diversity of plants when they are selective as well as efficient consumers. However, even under such conditions granivore impact will ultimately depend on whether environmental stress obscures plant-animal interactions. We studied diet and seed selection patterns of seed-eating birds to corroborate whether they are selective consumers in the central Monte desert of Argentina. Overall, 83{\%} of seeds in bird stomachs were grass seeds, whereas only 30{\%} of available seeds were from grass species. Therefore, we conclude that avian granivory is highly selective. We developed a set of a priori expectations to test whether birds are efficient consumers (i.e. whether they reduce seed reserves significantly), through short-term mechanism-explicit enclosure experiments. Birds decreased the number of selected grass seeds by ?50{\%}, and also reduced the amount of non-selected grasses and selected forbs when selected grass seeds were scarce in the habitat. Thus, consumption was context-dependent, varying with the composition of background seed reserves. The corroboration of foraging plasticity through mechanism-explicit trials seems to be crucial to correctly assign direct and indirect effects of seed predation in long-term enclosure experiments. The comparison of average grass seed reduction caused by bird predation with mean declines of grass seedlings caused by senescence (ca 95{\%}) allowed us assess top-down (e.g. seed availability) vs bottom-up control (e.g. rainfall) on grass recruitment. Despite moderate to high seed predation, the number of grass seeds that remains in the soil in spring would not limit seed germination and seedling recruitment. By contrast, safe-site availability and drought may be important factors limiting grass recruitment, at least in the undisturbed habitats of the Biosphere Reserve of {\~{N}}acu{\~{n}}{\'{a}}n.},

abstract = {Theory suggests that host-parasite interaction should lead to local adaptation of parasites to their host. In mistletoe host tree interactions the foraging patterns of fruit-eating birds can play an important role in host local adaptation, depending on the tree species on which the mistletoe fruits were consumed (host provenance) and the tree species on which the mistletoe seeds were deposited (host fate). Yet this interaction has not been previously documented. To determine the effects of host provenance, bird gut processing, and host fate on mistletoe seed germination and seedling establishment of Psittacanthus calyculatus, we conducted a seed inoculation experiment in Tlaxcala, Mexico. Mistletoe fruits were collected from Crataegus pubescens (Cp), Prunus serotina (Ps), and Salix bonplandiana (Sb) and measured. We then manually removed the exocarp and pulp of half the fruits, and the other half were given to grey silky-flycatchers (Ptilogonys cinereus) for gut processing. Obtained seeds of both groups of fruits were measured and deposited on branches of other trees of the same 3 host species in a full factorial design. Mistletoe fruit size varied significantly among host tree species, but differences did not coincide with those in gut retention time. Bird gut processing and the host provenance x host fate interaction were the best predictors for the occurrence of germination and establishment of seedlings. Seed germination and seedling establishment were more likely when seeds were gut processed by birds, but gut retention time had no significant effects. The significant host provenance x host fate interaction was largely due to higher success of mistletoe seeds from Sb to Sb and lower success from Sb to Ps. Our results suggest that to understand the efficiency of infection of P. calyculatus and possibly other mistletoe species, the linked effects of the digestive processes undergone by mistletoe seeds and the species of host trees where the seeds were consumed and ultimately deposited should be considered.},

abstract = {. We studied variation in flowering phenology, fruit and seed set, and the abundance of the pol- linators of four species of night-blooming Sonoran Desert columnar cacti for up to eight years at one site in Mexico and one year at one site in Arizona. We determined how spatiotemporal variation in plant-pollinator interactions affects the evolution of generalized pollination systems. We conducted pollinator exclusion and hand pollination experiments to document annual variability in pollinator reliability and to determine whether pollination systems were redundant (different species are partially or totally substitutable) or complementary (different species have an additive effect on fruit set). The cacti we studied included three species with generalized pollination systems involving bats, birds, and bees (cardon, 'achycereus pringlei; saguaro, Carnegiea gigantea; and organ pipe, Stenocereus thurberi) and one specialized moth-pollinated species (senita, Lophocereus schottii). We predicted that the migratory lesser long-nosed bat, Leptonycteris curasoae, is a less reliable pollinator than birds and bees, and that cacti with generalized pollination systems have more variable flowering phenologies than the specialized species. Annual time of peak flowering and mean size of flower crops were relatively invariant in saguaro and organ pipe. Time of peak flowering in cardon varied by as much as six weeks, and mean flower crop size varied three- fold over six years. In senita, peak flowering varied by as much as 5-8 wk among years. Peak numbers of the nectar bat L. curasoae varied among years, and bat density (0.9/ha) was an order of magnitude lower than that of cactus-visiting birds at both study sites. The abundance of migratory hummingbirds was also highly variable among years. Pollinator exclusion experiments indicated that bats were major pollinators of cardon, whereas diurnal vis accounted for most fruit set in saguaro (except in 1995 when bats were most important) and organ pipe at Mexican site; honeybees accounted for 64-87{\%} of diurnal fruit set in these species. Annual variation in t contribution to fruit set by bats was substantially higher than that of diurnal pollinators in saguaro and pipe, but not in cardon. There was little geographic variation in the relative importance of nocturnal vs. di pollinators in saguaro and senita, but bats were much more important for fruit set in organ pipe in Arizona in Mexico. We generally detected no effect of different pollinators on number of seeds per fruit in any sp Annual variation in fruit set was lowest in saguaro, the species with the most diurnal pollination syste and highest in organ pipe, the species with the most generalized pollination system. Fruit set was strongly p limited only in females of cardon (a trioecious species) and in organ pipe (at both sites). The "missing" pollin in both species are likely Leptonycteris bats. The pollination systems of saguaro and cardon were partia redundant, whereas that of organ pipe was complementary. The four species of cactus that we studied occur at the northern geographic limits of Mexican columnar where many vertebrate pollinators are seasonal migrants. In the Sonoran Desert, variation in rainfall and sp temperatures affects timing of flowering and the extent of competition between cacti for pollinator visits causes the relative importance of particular pollinators, especially Leptonycteris bats, for fruit set to vary ann Under such conditions, selection has favored generalized pollination systems (as seen in organ pipe) or sh from reliance primarily on nocturnal pollinators (as seen in cardon) to reliance primarily on diurnal pollin (as seen in saguaro). Nonetheless, as exemplified by the senita-senita moth system, highly specialized pollina mutualisms can also evolve in this habitat in plants that rely on sedentary insects rather than migratory and birds for pollination.

abstract = {1. The directed-dispersal (DrD) hypothesis constitutes one of the main explanations for the adaptive value of seed dispersal in spatially heterogeneous environments. Traditionally, the DrD hypothesis asserts non-random arrival to specific sites where establishment conditions are independently favourable. Yet, enhanced arrival might negatively affect the establishment in otherwise favourable sites through enhanced density-dependent mortality (DDM). Since both density effects and habitat suitability might differ among establishment phases, assessment of habitat suitability should encompass the entire establishment process.2. Here, we test the DrD hypothesis against a null model of random dispersal (RD) in an arid ecosystem where fleshy-fruited perennial Ochradenus baccatus shrubs are dispersed by two resident passerines. Acacia trees were predicted to present the favourable habitat in our system through the nurse-plant effect facilitating O. baccatus early establishment.3. We determined expected seed arrival by monitoring the dispersers' time allocation among the different habitats and assessed habitat quality for different establishment phases: seed-phase survival (post-dispersal survival and germination) was determined by line transects, while early seedling survival was estimated by monitoring seedlings throughout the first dry season. Additionally, subsequent recruitment success was assessed by comparing the distribution of adult shrubs to that expected from the observed germination patterns.4. When considering the expected seed arrival and early establishment (seed-phase and early seedling survival), the DrD hypothesis is supported: birds preferentially deposited seeds in habitats where conditions are favourable (e.g. under Acacia trees). Yet, considering recruitment success during later phases, the dispersal service provided by the birds was less beneficial than RD.5. Effective density was indexed using the zone-of-influence approach in which densities are corrected by phase-specific sizes. We suggest that intense seed deposition into favourable habitats has led to strong DDM (presumably through competition) in those habitats during late establishment phases and was responsible, at least partially, for changes in habitat suitability across the recruitment phases.6. Synthesis. Our results show that assessment of the DrD hypothesis depends on the context of the study (in terms of recruitment phases) since sites of enhanced seed arrival and high seed-to-seedling survival can ultimately prove unfavourable to the plant if density-dependent or other effects might increase mortality in these sites during later recruitment phases.},

abstract = {1. The study of plant-pollinator interactions in a network context is receiving increasing attention. This approach has helped to identify several emerging network patterns such as nestedness and modularity. However, most studies are based only on qualitative information, and some ecosystems, such as deserts and tropical forests, are underrepresented in these data sets. 2. We present an exhaustive analysis of the structure of a 4-year plant-pollinator network from the Monte desert in Argentina using qualitative and quantitative tools. We describe the structure of this network and evaluate sampling completeness using asymptotic species richness estimators. Our goal is to assess the extent to which the realized sampling effort allows for an accurate description of species interactions and to estimate the minimum number of additional censuses required to detect 90{\%} of the interactions. We evaluated completeness of detection of the community-wide pollinator fauna, of the pollinator fauna associated with each plant species and of the plant-pollinator interactions. We also evaluated whether sampling completeness was influenced by plant characteristics, such as flower abundance, flower life span, number of interspecific links (degree) and selectiveness in the identity of their flower visitors, as well as sampling effort. 3. We found that this desert plant-pollinator network has a nested structure and that it exhibits modularity and high network-level generalization. 4. In spite of our high sampling effort, and although we sampled 80{\%} of the pollinator fauna, we recorded only 55{\%} of the interactions. Furthermore, although a 64{\%} increase in sampling effort would suffice to detect 90{\%} of the pollinator species, a fivefold increase in sampling effort would be necessary to detect 90{\%} of the interactions. 5. Detection of interactions was incomplete for most plant species, particularly specialists with a long flowering season and high flower abundance, or generalists with short flowering span and scant flowers. Our results suggest that sampling of a network with the same effort for all plant species is inadequate to sample interactions. 6. Sampling the diversity of interactions is labour intensive, and most plant-pollinator networks published to date are likely to be undersampled. Our analysis allowed estimating the completeness of our sampling, the additional effort needed to detect most interactions and the plant traits that influence the detection of their interactions.},

abstract = {Background: Carrizo Plain National Monument (San Joaquin Desert, California, USA) is home to many threatened and endangered species including the blunt-nosed leopard lizard (Gambelia sila). Vegetation is dominated by annual grasses, and shrubs such as Mormon tea (Ephedra californica), which is of relevance to our target species, the federally listed blunt-nosed leopard lizard, and likely also provides key ecosystem services. We used relatively nonintrusive camera traps, or trail cameras, to capture interactions between animals and these shrubs using a paired shrub-open deployment. Cameras were placed within the shrub understory and in open microhabitats at ground level to estimate animal activity and determine species presence. Findings: Twenty cameras were deployed from April 1st, 2015 to July 5th, 2015 at paired shrub-open microsites at three locations. Over 425,000 pictures were taken during this time, of which 0.4 {\%} detected mammals, birds, insects, and reptiles including the blunt-nosed leopard lizard. Trigger rate was very high on the medium sensitivity camera setting in this desert ecosystem, and rates did not differ between microsites. Conclusions: Camera traps are an effective, less invasive survey method for collecting data on the presence or absence of desert animals in shrub and open microhabitats. A more extensive array of cameras within an arid region would thus be an effective tool to estimate the presence of desert animals and potentially detect habitat use patterns.},

abstract = {In this review, we compiled published results on biological interactions at different spatial scales in the Monte desert of Argentina and identified gaps in current knowledge. We presented evidence of competitive and facilitative plant-plant conspecific and heterospecific interactions, and plant-soil-microbes interactions in relation to the abiotic environment at the fine patch-scale. We also showed evidence of animal-animal interactions and plant-animal interactions at the community scale through study cases involving both native and introduced herbivores. Moreover, we identified bottom-up and top-down forces governing the interactions between granivores (birds, ants, and small mammals) and seed availability/production at the community scale. At the landscape scale, we discussed feedbacks between domestic grazers and the spatial patterns of resources and their interrelationships with processes occurring at other scales. We concluded that research has steadily increased during the last 6 years but knowledge on biological interactions in the Monte desert is still scarce, particularly at a landscape scale. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study compares the post-dispersal predation of seeds from the cacti Myrtillocactus geometrizans and Opuntia pilifera by diurnal vertebrates, nocturnal vertebrates, and ants under nurse plants in three plant associations found in the semiarid scrubland of Tehuac??n Valley (Mexico). Experiments on seed removal showed that, regardless of cactus species and plant association, ants were the main seed predators. Predation of M. geometrizans seeds varied depending on plant association and predator type, but it could not be associated with the abundance of granivore guilds; seed predation was more prominent in scrublands dominated by Beaucarnea gracilis. For O. pilifera, seed predation by ants was more intense in scrublands dominated by Neobuxbaumia tetetzo, but there was a significant interaction between plant association and predator type. These results support the existence of spatial variability in interactions between seeds and granivores above the microhabitat scale, which-to varying degrees of intensity-influences the distribution of seeds dispersed by frugivorous animals. This among-plant association variability in seed-granivore interactions, in addition to the within-plant association variability (e.g. nurse canopy vs. open area), should be taken into account when studying the causes of differential recruitment of plant species in arid environments. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Several methods have been proposed to overcome these artifacts, but they have the limitation of being based on visitation data, causing interactions involving rare visitor species to remain undersampled. We propose the analysis of food composition in bee trap nests to assess the reliability of network specialization estimates. We compared data from a plantpollinator network in the Monte Desert of Villavicencio Nature Reserve, Argentina, sampled by visit observation, and data from trap nests sampled at the same time and location. Our study shows that trap nest sampling was good for estimating rare species degree. The rare species in the networks appear to be more specialized than they really are, and the bias in the estimation of the species degree increases with the rareness. The low species degree of these rare species in the visitation networks results from insufficient sampling of the rare interactions, which could have important consequences for network structure.},

We recorded presence/absence of plants under the canopy of 19 trees in Ischigualasto Provincial Park. Moreover, we recorded abundance of birds and mammals and signs of mammal activity using camera traps. Our camera traps captured more than 80, 90 and 50 {\%} of plants, birds and mammals, respectively. The coverage estimate was 83 {\%} for birds and 89 {\%} for mammals. Bird species richness decreased by -43 {\%}, for every unit increase in number of stems; although richness of plants and mammals was not explained by any variable considered. Birds and mammal species invested more time in foraging than they did in moving or resting under canopies. The abundance of South American gray fox (Lycalopex griseus) increased 9 {\%} with abundance of birds, though not with abundance of mammals.

abstract = {The nutrients animals ingest are allocated to serve different functions. We used contrasting C stable isotope signatures of dominant vegetation types in a North American subtropical desert to decipher how avian consumers allocate nutrients to fuel oxidative metabolism and to construct tissues. We conducted C stable isotope analysis of breath and feathers collected from nectarivores (hummingbirds) and of breath, plasma, and red blood cell samples collected from frugivores, granivores, and insectivores. Based on varying nutrient characteristics of food sources, we expected that for frugivores and granivores, CAM-derived food (RCCAM) would have similar importance for oxidative metabolism and for tissue building, that RCCAM in nectarivores and insectivores would be more important for fueling metabolism than for generating tissues, and that (although low) RCCAM in insectivores would be higher for sustaining metabolism than for building tissues. Our predictions held true for nectarivores and granivores, but RCCAM use in tissue building was lower than expected in frugivores and higher than expected in insectivores. Our examination at the trophic guild, population, and individual levels showed that in general, nutrients used to sustain oxidative metabolism and tissue construction had a uniform isotopic origin. This finding suggests that the avian community under investigation does not route different food groups to fulfill different needs. However, we found some exceptions, indicating that birds can use different food sources for different functions, irrespective of trophic guild.},

abstract = {.Secondary seed dispersal is a multistep process with two or more phases, which involve different dispersers that usually extend the distance fromthe seed's parent plant. This ecological process has been recorded in some subtropical oceanic islands, where predatory birds commonly consume frugivorous lizards and disperse seeds already consumed by the lizards. 2. We evaluated the overall importance of this type of secondary dispersal in the Canary Islands, the only place worldwidewhere it has been studied in depth. Froman examination of all the islands and their suitable habitats, we found seeds from 78 plant species inside 2098 shrike pellets and 5304 kestrel pellets.Agreater number of specieswere secondarily dispersed by kestrels (76; 97{\%})than by shrikes (26; 34{\%}). 3. Forty-four (56{\%}) of the total species detected in pellets were identified at the species level, comprising 73{\%} native and 27{\%} introduced species. Seventy per cent of these identified species were fleshy fruit-bearing plants and 84{\%} of the interactions took place in open habitats, close to coastal areas. 4. Germination experiments showed that seeds of at least 32 plant species were viable after being removed from the bird pellets. A similar pattern of seed germination was detected for seeds from the droppings of lizards and pellets of shrikes, showing both to be effective dispersers.However, the seeds dispersed by kestrels had different levels of success depending on the number of gut passages experienced. Seeds that had undergone double gut treatment (lizard and secondary ingestion by kestrel) had reduced germination rates ofmany small- andmedium-sized seeds comparedwith seeds ingested by lizards and discarded inside the lizard guts by kestrels. 5. Wealso studied the relationship between body length and gapewidth of lizards in order to assess limitations on the sizes and quantities of seeds available for secondary dispersal. Kestrels can disperse a greater number and variety of seeds because they predate larger lizards that potentially carry greater seed loads. 6. Synthesis. The current results show how these non-standard long-distance dispersal events produced by predatory birds can be considered as a regular and generalized process on all islands of theCanary archipelago},

In four separate feeding trials, we provisioned jays with the following: Trial 1, two nuts each of white oak (Quercus alba), pin oak (Q. palustris), black oak (Q. velutina), northern red oak (Q. rubra), and shagbark hickory (Carya ovata); Trial 2, two small and two large red oak acorns; Trial 3, two germinating and two nongerminating white oak acorns; and Trial 4, one large red oak acorn, one large white oak acorn, and one shagbark hickory nut. We used discrete choice models to describe selection under conditions of changing choice sets. Blue Jays displayed a clear preference for pin oak and strong avoidance of red oak acorns when alternative foods were available. White oak and black oak acorns were selected intermediately. Shagbark hickory nuts were never used. Correlation coefficients suggested that preference was inversely related to seed size and the proportion of seed consisting of hard seed coat. In the absence of alternative food items, small red oak acorns were readily taken, whereas large red oak acorns were mostly avoided but still used by some birds. These results highlight the importance of considering food availability when making conclusions about preference, and lend support to the hypothesis that Blue Jays can be important dispersers of even less-preferred oak species. We discuss the potential as well as the limitations for Blue Jays to act as seed dispersers, with respect to postglacial range expansion of fagaceous tree species, and in the context of present-day dispersal in regions where forests are highly fragmented.},

abstract = {Summary 1 We explored whether seedling recruitment was spatially predicted by seed rain (spatial concordance) at different scales (microsite, microhabitat and site) in the bird-dispersed trees Crataegus monogyna, Ilex aquifolium and Taxus baccata, in temperate secondary forests in north-west Spain. 2 We propose that both spatial concordance within each scale and consistency of concordance patterns across scales are dependent on differences between seed rain and post-dispersal processes in the partitioning of spatial variance at each scale. 3 We measured the density of dispersed seeds, the percentage of post-dispersal seed predation by rodents and the density of emerged first-year seedlings at sampling stations distributed throughout five microhabitats (under canopies of parental trees and in open gaps) and four localities over two seasons. 4 Seed rain density of all tree species varied most at the microhabitat scale, but microsite and site differences accounted for most of the spatial variance in post-dispersal seed predation and, especially, in seedling establishment. 5 All three species showed concordance between seed rain and seedling establishment at the microhabitat scale, because strong patchiness in avian-generated seed rain overrode the slight uncoupling effects exerted by the more homogeneous post-dispersal processes. Seed rain was also a good predictor of recruitment of Ilex and Crataegus at the microsite scale, but, for Taxus, the rather homogeneous dispersal across microsites contrasted with the heterogeneous post-dispersal losses. At the site scale, only Taxus showed a positive trend of concordance. 6 Concordance patterns were maintained from microsite to microhabitat in Crataegus and Ilex, and from microhabitat to site in Taxus. Low-variance allocation to the site scale at the seed rain stage precluded complete consistency in Crataegus and Ilex. 7 Positive responses of recruitment to seed dispersal depended on both species and scale, resulting in a complex template for dispersal-limitation effects on metapopulations and communities},

abstract = {Migratory frugivorous birds disperse the seeds of many plant species, forming mutualistic associations that render frugivores a priority for conservation in many habitats worldwide. We analysed the distribution of seed-dispersing frugivorous passerines in southern Spain, which is an important area for the conservation of European birds during winter. Frugivorous birds showed similar regional abundance and richness during four winters, although fruit availability changed among years. However, the spatial distribution of frugivorous birds in the area changed among years. These changes were principally determined by annual variation in the distribution of fruits in the area, revealing a clear ability of birds to track the distribution of fruits. The unpredictable distribution of fruits each year suggests that regional fruit crops, rather than selected habitat patches, need to be protected for the long-term conservation of frugivorous bird populations in wintering grounds. Remarkably, the distribution of frugivores was independent of forest development or general cover of shrubs, which helps to reconcile the protection of fruiting shrubs with forest cleaning, an usual management to prevent devastating summer fires that is destroying fleshy-fruited plant communities in many areas of southern Spain. Thus, leaving a part of the fruiting shrubs untouched when cleaning forest undergrowth will allow the settlement of frugivorous birds. Interestingly, both abundance and richness of frugivores decreased with elevation, probably as a consequence of impaired climatic conditions at high altitude, revealing the importance of lowland shrublands as wintering grounds for frugivorous birds. These habitats deserve special conservation efforts, as they are seriously threatened by the ongoing encroachment of agricultural and urban areas along the Mediterranean coasts. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Facilitation between different plant species has been documented in terrestrial and marine ecosystems worldwide. The classic example of such positive relationships, the large keystone saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea), always establishes under nurse plants that provide protection to young seedlings through subcanopy climate and environmental modification. Plants (e.g., nurse plants) are not necessarily symmetrical and variations in shape and zone of influence may impact the distribution of other species associated with them. The saguaro is distributed disproportionately to the south of its nurse tree Cercidium microphyllum (palo verde) where subcanopy temperatures are warmer on cold winter nights. I determine whether the tree's canopy shape contributes to the non-random pattern of its prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}} cacti in its subcanopy. Data for tree canopy width for each of the four cardinal directions were collected. ANOVA and circular statistics (Rayleigh and V tests) found a significant canopy bias to the southwest. A second dataset shows that Carnegiea are found significantly more often to the south of Cercidium trunks than to the north. When the center of canopy is used rather than the trunk, the statistical bias no longer holds. The observed biases in distribution may be a function of the nurse's canopy shape and resultant microclimate effects. The findings of this study provide an explanation to several already documented observations: 1) winter temperatures are more ameliorated to the south of the trunk than to the north, 2) more of the shade-dependent cacti are found on the south side of their Cercidium nurse's trunk than to the north, and 3) saguaro cacti show a distributional preference to dense-canopied nurses. Variations in nurse canopies become crucial elements of the microenvironment and will alter patterns of establishment and survival of the prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}} species that rely on them as even small changes can dramatically alter distributional patterns and expected survivorship. Nurse protection may lead to patterns quite different from the seed rain, and ultimately has a dominant role in the population dynamics of the species.},

abstract = {Seed dormancy and endozoochorous dispersal have important effects on population dynamics, i.e. seed bank formation, spatial and temporal bet-hedging, avoidance of crowding and decreased sib-competition. Seeds having primary dormancy do not germinate, even if adequate environmental and dispersal conditions are met, until an after-ripening period is completed. This study examined the effects on germination rates of seed dispersal by vertebrates and primary dormancy (i.e. how germination rates changed in time) in the prickly pearOpuntia rastrerafrom the southern Chihuahuan Desert. Ripe fruits, scats of coyote, mule deer, woodrat, common pig and pellets of the northern raven were collected in 1992 during the ripe fruit peak (August). A factorial design was used to assess the effect of disperser and seed age on germination rates using these seeds collected in 1992. In 1992, 1993 and 1994 (fresh, 1- and 2-year-old seeds, respectively) germination success after 3 months was determined for 100 seeds of each disperser, plus a control of uneaten seeds. We found differences in germination rates both between dispersers and years. All but one disperser (deer) decreased germination rates with respect to the control. Germination steadily increased with ageing of seeds, implying the presence of primary dormancy (embryo immaturity). Our results show that despite the large disperser coterie associated withOpuntia rastrera, seeds have an obligate primary dormancy which seems to result in seed bank formation. Seed germination and seedling establishment will depend on selection pressures caused mainly by environmental variability in deserts (unpredictable rainfall, extreme temperatures, safe-site availability). Nevertheless, endozoochorous dispersal provides some additional advantages (e.g. habitat colonization, genetic variability, avoidance of long-term local extinction) that needs further research.},

abstract = {Vivipary, the germination of seeds before they are shed from the parent plant, is a rare event in angiosperms involving complex ecophysiological processes. Pseudovivipary and cryptovivipary occur in approximately 30 (2{\%}) species of the cactus family. A remarkable case of vivipary in Epiphyllum phyllanthus is described here. Information is provided regarding the biology of viviparous fruits, morphology, mortality, survival rates of viviparous offspring, and some eco-evolutionary implications of this reproductive strategy in the Cactaceae. This epiphytic cactus has no host-specific relationship. A low proportion (33.3{\%}) of individuals produced viviparous fruits. Seed number/fruit varied from 197 to 230 with percentage of viviparous germination from 97.5{\%} to 99{\%}. The viviparous seedlings exhibited normal development and were no different from non-viviparous offspring. Transplanting experiments showed that the first week is critical for seedling establishment, and high mortality occurred in the three treatments used: 69{\%} on the phorophyte surface, 58.6{\%} on the ground, and 44.8{\%} under controlled conditions. The number of survivors gradually stabilized, and the contribution to establishment was comparable in each of the treatments after the acclimation phase. It is suggested that vivipary is associated with thermoregulation, parental care, conspecific nursing, and rapid seedling establishment. Germination is not a limiting factor in the perpetuation of this viviparous species, but seedling establishment is. In viviparous individuals of E. phyllanthus, seedling mortality during establishment rather than failure to germinate within the fruit is a limiting factor affecting local population density. Overall, viviparity is an intrinsic, genetic event involving high metabolic costs favouring germination and dispersal of the fittest offspring regardless of substrate and environmental conditions.},

Much attention to declining populations has focused on how changing climate drives phenological mismatches between animals and their food(4-6). Effects of climate on plant communities may provide an alternative, but particularly powerful, influence on animal populations because plants provide their habitats. Here, we show that abundances of deciduous trees and associated songbirds have declined with decreasing snowfall over 22 years of study in montane Arizona, USA. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that declining snowfall indirectly influences plants and associated birds by allowing greater over-winter herbivory by elk (Cervus canadensis). We excluded elk from one of two paired snowmelt drainages (10 ha per drainage), and replicated this paired experiment across three distant canyons. Over six years, we reversed multi-decade declines in plant and bird populations by experimentally inhibiting heavy winter herbivory associated with declining snowfall. Moreover, predation rates on songbird nests decreased in exclosures, despite higher abundances of nest predators, demonstrating the over-riding importance of habitat quality to avian recruitment. Thus, our results suggest that climate impacts on plant-animal interactions can have forceful ramifying effects on plants, birds, and ecological interactions},

The card6n population had two peak fruiting seasons (late May-early June and late August-early September) which correspond to the local rainy seasons, but many plants also produce low numbers of fruits throughout the year. Fruits were fed on continuously by a variety of consumers for several days while still attached to the plant. The avian consumer set induded 14 species and was dominated by two species of parrots (Aratinga pertinfax and the endangered Amazona barbadensis). Most of the avian consumers are omnivores that indude variable amounts of fruit in their diet. Feeding observations in the wild, captive feeding trials, and seed germination trials indicated that six of the bird species are seed predators, six act as seed dispersers, and two are neutral with respect to seed survival. Bats fed on the fruits but were unable to open the husks, and thus must rely on naturally dehisced fruits or fruits opened by psittacines. RESUMEN},

The present work sought to characterize the fruiting patterns of the native Caatinga (dryland) cactus Cereus jamacaru, identify its principal dispersers, and evaluate the effects of seed passage through digestive tract of dispersers on its germination. Cereus jamacaru present an annual fruiting pattern and fruiting peaks occurred during June/2009 and February/2010. A total of 135 visits by nine species of resident Caatinga bird species were recorded. The most frequent visiting bird species were Paroaria dominicana and Euphonia chlorotica. Length of bird visits varied from 15 seconds to 4 minutes and seeds removed by birds travelled 10.6 ± 11.2 m until dispersers make the first landing perch, in some cases more than 40 meters away. Germination tests show birds had a high quantity of viable seeds of C. jamacaru in its feces. Seeds that passed through the digestive tract of birds showed a similar germinability of the seeds of the control group. However, the seeds dispersed by birds showed lowest mean germination time related to the control group seeds. This study highlights the potential role of birds as seed dispersers of C. jamacaru, swallowing the whole seeds and defecating intact seeds, accelerating the germination process and transporting seeds away from the mother plant.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We define seed limitation to be an increase in population size following seed addition. Here, we briefly consider how theoretical models deal with seed limitation and how seed sowing experiments can be used to unravel the extent of seed limitation in natural systems. We review two types of seed addition experiments: seed augmenta- tion studies where seeds are added to existing populations; and seed introductions where seeds are sown in unoccupied sites. Overall, approximately 50{\%} of seed augmentation experiments show evidence of seed limitation. These studies show that seed limitation tends to occur more commonly in early successional habitats and in early successional species. Most of the studies have concentrated on simply categoris- ing populations as seed- or microsite-limited, but we believe that seed sowing experiments could be used to reveal much more about community structure, and we discuss possible future directions. In 53{\%} of introduction studies (where seeds were sown at sites from which the species was known to be absent) the introduced species was recorded in at least one of the experimental sites following sowing. However, of the subset of studies where both seedlings and adult plants were recorded, 64{\%} of sites contained seedlings while only 23{\%} contained adults. This implies that, for many species, conditions for establish- ment are more stringent than conditions for germination. The successful establish- ment of plants in unoccupied patches indicates the potential for immigration to enhance local diversity (the spatial mass effect). Few studies continued monitoring for long enough to determine whether or not self-sustaining populations were success- fully established, and no study attempted to link introduction sites to a putative natural source of propagules, or considered the dynamics of the metapopulation as a whole.},

abstract = {1. Competition has historically been viewed as the predominant process affecting plant community structure. In particular, it is often assumed that the dominant resident species is the superior compet- itor and therefore has large impacts on plant community diversity. This assumption, however, is sel- dom tested. As well, there are a variety of other processes such as dispersal limitation and seed predation that can influence community structure, although the relative importance of these processes in relation to competition from resident species is still unclear. 2. We examined how interspecific competition, dispersal limitation and post-dispersal seed predation by mice individually and interactively influenced the richness and diversity of local plant assem- blages in grasslands of western Montana. 3. We added seeds of 20 mostly locally uncommon native species to subplots in and out of larger rodent exclosure plots. Using a ‘species-blind' approach, we manipulated competition from resident plants in these subplots by removing the same amount of cover of one dominant species or several common species. 4. The species richness and diversity of local assemblages was higher in subplots with seed addition than without. Across all levels of the other treatments, average richness for subplots without compet- itor removal was lower than for competitor removal treatments. However, the removal of one locally dominant species had similar effects to removal of several common species. In contrast, preventing seed predation by mice did not have significant effects on richness. There were no significant inter- actions between the treatments. 5. Synthesis. Our results reveal a hierarchy of filters that determine local community structure. Many regionally rare species were dispersal limited and established after the seed addition, regardless of release from competition or the presence of seed predators. Subsequently, we found competitive equivalence between dominant and common species. Key-words:},

Because interaction frequency is easier to estimate than per-interaction effect, using interaction frequency as a surrogate of total effect could facilitate the large-scale analysis of quantitative patterns of species-rich interaction networks. We show mathematically that the correlation between interaction frequency (I) and total effect (T) becomes more strongly positive the greater the variation of I relative to the variation of per-interaction effect (P) and the greater the correlation between I and P. A meta-analysis using data on I, P and T for animal pollinators and seed dispersers visiting plants shows a generally strong, positive relationship between T and I, in spite of no general relationship between P and I. Thus, frequent animal mutualists usually contribute the most to plant reproduction, regardless of their effectiveness on a per-interaction basis.},

abstract = {The ecological significance of spacing among plants in contributing to the maintenance of species richness, particularly in tropical forests, has received considerable attention that has largely focussed on distance- and density-dependent seed and seedling mortality. More recently it has become apparent that plant spacing is also relevant to pollination, which often constrains seed production. While seed and seedling survival is reduced at high conspecific densities, pollination success, by contrast, is positively correlated to local conspecific density. Distance-dependent mechanisms acting on pollination and seed production have now been described for a variety of plants, with relatively isolated plants or fragmented populations generally suffering reduced fecundity due to pollen limitation. Yet there is considerable variability in the vulnerability of plant species to pollination failure, which may be a function of breeding system, life history, the pollination vector, the degree of specialisation among plants and their pollinators, and other indirect effects of habitat change acting on plants or pollinators. As reduced tree densities and population fragmentation are common outcomes of anthropogenically altered landscapes, understanding how pollination processes are affected in such degraded landscapes can inform effective conservation and management of remaining natural areas.},

abstract = {t. Species loss can lead to cascading effects on communities, including the disruption of ecological processes such as seed dispersal. The endangered 'Alala ( Corvus hawaiiensis ), the largest remaining species of native Hawaiian forest bird, was once common in mesic and dry forests on the Big Island of Hawai'i, but today it exists solely in captivity. Prior to its extinction in the wild, the 'Alala may have helped to establish and maintain native Hawaiian forest communities by dispersing seeds of a wide variety of native plants. In the absence of 'Alal{\~{a}}, the structure and composition of Hawai'i's forests may be changing, and some large-fruited plants may be dispersal limited, persisting primarily as ecological anachronisms. We fed captive 'Alala a variety of native fruits, documented behaviors relating to seed dispersal, and measured the germination success of seeds that passed through the gut of 'Alal{\~{a}} relative to the germination success of seeds in control groups. 'Alal{\~{a}} ate and carried 14 native fruits and provided germination benefits to several species by ingesting their seeds. Our results suggest that some plants rely heavily on 'Alal{\~{a}} for these services. In captivity, juvenile birds displayed seed dispersal behaviors more often than adult birds for most fruiting plants in our study. We introduced captive 'Alal{\~{a}} to two large-fruited, dry-forest plants, not previously recorded as 'Alal{\~{a}} food resources, but which may once have been part of their natural diet. The seed dispersal behavior that 'Alal{\~{a}} displayed toward these species supports the inclusion of dry and mesic forests in 'Alal{\~{a}} habitat restoration plans and adds weight to the idea that plant dispersal limitation may contribute to the rarity of these plants. Our study provides evidence that 'Alal{\~{a}} have the capacity to play a vital role in maintaining the diversity of fruiting plants in native Hawaiian forests through seed dispersal and enhanced seed germination, thus adding greater urgency to efforts to restore 'Alal{\~{a}} to their},

abstract = {The role of the common raven (Corvus corax; Corvidae) as a seed dispersal agent for plants in the Canary Islands was studied by analysing 2672 pellets collected from all islands of the archipelago. Seeds of 16 species of phanerogams were found (four endemic to the Canaries, three endemic to the Macaronesian islands, six not endemic, and three introduced by man). Vegetation in this archipelago is highly structured according to altitude creating different types of macrohabitats. The quality of the transport of seeds between habitats was evaluated in a preliminary way by making use of the very high fidelity of the plant species to particular macrohabitats. Of the 102 580 potentially fertile seeds (excepting the other 51 061 infertile Ficus carica seeds) transported by common ravens, 76.5{\%} were regurgitated in theoretically suitable habitat while the remaining 23.5{\%} were taken to habitats that were not appropriate for the establishment. Common ravens improved germination of six species, whereas an opposite effect was observed for three others. The percentage of viable seeds did not differ for any species between pellet seeds and seeds collected directly from the plants. Considering results from germination and viability experiments and macrohabitat patterns of dispersal, the common raven seems to be an important disperser for nine plant species: Lycium intricatum (Solanaceae), Opuntia ficus-indica (Cactaceae), Rubia fruticosa and Plocama pendula (Rubiaceae), Juniperus turbinata and J. cedrus (Cupressaceae), Phoenix canariensis (Arecaceae), Asparagus pastorianus (Liliaceae), and Myrica faya (Myricaceae).},

We examined the breeding and pollination systems, level of pollen limitation and seed production in populations of a threatened ‘‘ornithophilous'' species, Aloe pruinosa. Experimen- tal hand-pollinations showed that A. pruinosa is genetically self-incompatible and thus an obligate outcrosser. Experimental exclusion of birds from inflorescences did not affect seed production, suggest- ing that insects are effective pollinators. Supplemental hand-pollinations in several populations showed that seed production in A. pruinosa is not pollen limited. Further, there were no significant relationships between population size and any measure of repro- ductive success in this Aloe species. Small populations of A. pruinosa are thus viable in terms of pollination processes and should be protected from more direct threats, such as habitat alteration},

The flowers of E. arizonicus are large, bright red, and cup-shaped. Important flower visitors included hummingbirds and native halictid bees. Flower visitor guilds were similar between the wild population and the transplanted individuals (located in the Boyce Thompson Arboretum in Pinal County, Arizona), although the Arboretum is located at a low elevation and supports much higher abundances of flowering plants and pollinators than occur in the wild sites. Pollination treatments indicated E. arizonicus is highly self-incompatible but not pollen-limited and hummingbird visitation is relatively more important to seed set than is insect visitation but both contribute to total seed counts.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic activities, such as grazing by domestic animals, are considered drivers of environmental changes that may influence the structure of interaction networks. The study of individual-based networks allows testing how species-level interaction patterns emerge from the pooled interaction modes of individuals within populations. Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) examine the global structure of networks by allowing the inclusion of specific node (i.e. interacting partners) properties as explanatory covariates. Here we assessed the structure of individual plant–frugivore interaction networks and the ecological variables that influence the mode of interactions under different land-use (grazed versus ungrazed protected areas). We quantified the number of visits, the number of fruits removed per visit and the interaction strength of mammal frugivore species at each individual tree. Additionally we quantified ecological variables at the individual, microhabitat, neighborhood and habitat scales that generated interaction network structure under the different land uses. Individual plant–frugivore networks were significantly modular in both land uses but the number of modules was higher in the grazed areas. We found interaction networks for grazed and ungrazed lands were structured by phenotypic traits of individual trees, by the microhabitat beneath the tree canopy and were affected by habitat modifications of anthropogenic origin. The neighborhood surrounding each individual plant influenced plant–frugivore interactions only at the grazed-land trees. We conclude that anthropogenic land uses influence the topological patterns of plant–frugivore networks and the frugivore visitation to trees through modification of both habitat complexity and the ecological traits underlying interactions between individual plants and frugivore species.},

The terminology used to describe these limitations is, however, very inconsistent. Since the different terms often appear in conclusions of the papers, the inconsistency in their use obscures the message of these papers. In this study, we review the current uses of these terms, identify the basic concepts involved in the discussion of a limitation and link the concepts with the currently used terms. Finally, we discuss the experimental approaches used to assess the different types of limitations. We differentiated four basic concepts resulting from the combination of limitation by environment versus ability to grow and spread, and two spatial scales (local and regional scale). The two concepts at each spatial scale are expected to form a gradient of all possible combinations of the two respective types of limitations. In the considerations of various experimental approaches used to assess these limitations, we conclude that sowing experiments, i.e. seed addition into existing populations or seed introduction into unoccupied habitats, are the only reliable types of evidence for the different types of limitations.},

We test this hypothesis and explore its implications for the restoration of native ecosystems in one of the most dramatic ecological invasions worldwide, the replacement of native perennial grasses by exotic annual grasses and forbs in 9.2 million hectares of California grasslands. The long-term persistence of these exotic annuals has been thought to imply that the exotics are superior competitors. However, seed-addition experiments in a southern California grassland revealed that native perennial species, which had lower requirements for deep soil water, soil nitrate, and light, were strong competitors, and they markedly depressed the abundance and fecundity of exotic annuals after overcoming recruitment limitations. Native species reinvaded exotic grasslands across experimentally imposed nitrogen, water, and disturbance gradients. Thus, exotic annuals are not superior competitors but rather may dominate because of prior disturbance and the low dispersal abilities and extreme current rarity of native perennials. If our results prove to be general, it may be feasible to restore native California grassland flora to at least parts of its former range.},

abstract = {Pollination is the primary step in seed formation. Pollination biologists have shown that pollination failure can occur at all steps in the dispersal process and at several different levels. Increased risk of pollination failure is associated with pollen if it is delivered to a stigma too little, too much, too late, too mixed in composition or too poor in quality. It is associated with pollinators when they are too few or too inconstant, and with plants when they are too specialized or too selective. It is associated with populations when they are too sparse, too small in number or too uniform genetically, and with communities when they are too fragmented, genetically impoverished or under rapid modification. Understanding the causes of pollination failure in plants can aid the successful conservation and recovery of rare plants, maintenance of crop yields, and sustainable use of wild plant resources such as forest timber.},

Microsites are small-scale sites suitable for germination and survival of seedlings. We discuss this dichotomy of recruitment limitation both from a theoretical and empirical point of view. Investiga- tions of recruitment in 14 woodland species showed that 3 species were seed limited, 6 species were limited by a combination of seed and microsite availability, and 5 species were found not to be seed limited, but the limiting factor was not identified. A "combination of seed and microsite limitation" implies that recruitment is pro- moted by increasing both seed and microsite availability. We suggest that the importance of seed limitation in plant populations has been underestimated, and that the operating limiting factors may be dependent on spatial and temporal scale. We expect that many species, if adequately studied, will turn out to be both seed and microsite limited. Experimental field studies that incor- porate a range of seed and microsite "densities" in va- rious spatial and temporal scales are needed to examine the extent to which plant populations are seed and mi- crosite limited},

abstract = {Waxwings fed two types of artificial fruits with equal seed loads but with different seed sizes consumed significantly more of the larger-seeded fruits. Because large seeds were defecated more quickly than small seeds, the increase in fruit consumption indicated that wax- wings are process rate limited. Our experiments demonstrate that, for small seeds, differential processing of pulp and seeds can be much more complex than previously believed. Waxwings separated pulp from seeds and defecated seeds well in advance of pulp, thereby allowing both an increase in consumption and, presumably, a greater assimilation of nutrients in the pulp. We propose that rapid seed processing has influenced pulp composition and seed-packaging traits. In particular, the link between rapid passage of small seeds and pulp through the intestine may help explain why fleshy fruits are high in simple sugars and free amino acids. Likewise, the size and number of seeds in a fruit may in part be determined by a trade-off between the number of seeds ingested and how far they are dispersed. This evolutionary trade-off is likely influenced by the digestive strategies of volant frugivores to cope with gut processing limitations. Birds},

Internal dispersal was investigated by searching for seeds in faeces opportunistically collected at communal roosts, foraging sites and nests of eleven parrot species in different habitats and biomes in the Neotropics. Multiple intact seeds of seven plant species of five families were found in a variable proportion of faeces from four parrot species. The mean number of seeds of each plant species per dropping ranged between one and about sixty, with a maximum of almost five hundred seeds from the cacti {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Pilosocereus pachycladus{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} in a single dropping of Lear's Macaw ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Anodorhynchus leari{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ).

An overview of the potential constraints driving seed dispersal suggest that, despite the obvious size difference between seeds dispersed by endozoochory and stomatochory, there is no clear difference in fruit size depending on the dispersal mode. Regardless of the enhanced or limited germination capability after gut transit, a relatively large proportion of cacti seeds frequently found in the faeces of two parrot species were viable according to the tetrazolium test and germination experiments. The conservative results of our exploratory sampling and a literature review clearly indicate that the importance of parrots as endozoochorous dispersers has been largely under-appreciated due to the lack of research systematically searching for seeds in their faeces.

abstract = {Efforts to restore terrestrial woody ecosystems to former agricultural land are typically based on plant-focused actions, often neglecting fauna. However, the pro- cesses that maintain or restore the health and integrity of these ecosystems involve many animal–plant interactions. Here, I synthesise information about these relationships and the implications for revegetation practice. Fauna have often been viewed as passengers, responding passively to plant-focused revegetation. This view involves two surrogacy assumptions: first, that vegetation attributes can indicate habitat sufficiency for fauna; sec- ond, that animals will be capable of dispersing to the restored habitat and of establishing populations there. Habitat sufficiency depends on how resources such as food and nest sites can be indicated by vegetation attributes and how they interact with an animal's spe- cies-specific requirements. Dispersal and establishment depend on proximity to source populations in habitat elsewhere, the type of intervening habitat and the intrinsic mobility of different species. Evidence about the effects of age, revegetation type and spatial context in relation to animal communities indicates that it can often be invalid to assume vegetation surrogacy. Fauna can also drive the developmental trajectories of floristic diversity and composition during revegetation, because animal–plant interactions frequently mediate life-history transitions that determine seedling recruitment. Frugivore-mediated seed dis- persal is the best studied, but animals also directly influence early-stage tree recruitment, especially through their roles in seed predation, seedling herbivory and indirectly through top-down cascades that include large carnivores. These processes have been insufficiently recognised or studied, although some recent work highlights their significance. Intervening to alter abundances of functionally important animals could be useful in accelerating the redevelopment of woody vegetation. Further research is needed to clarify animals' roles as both passengers and drivers during revegetation, especially manipulative experiments and innovative restoration trials, in which animals and plants are considered together from the outset.

            of CNDD often assumed that all species are equally susceptible to CNDD; however, recent empirical studies have shown species can differ greatly in their
            susceptibility to CNDD. Using a theoretical model, we show that interspecific variation in CNDD can dramatically alter its impact on diversity. First, if the most common species
            are the least regulated by CNDD, then the stabilising benefit of CNDD is reduced. Second, when seed dispersal is limited, seedlings that are susceptible
            to CNDD are at a competitive disadvantage. When parameterised with estimates of CNDD from a tropical tree community in Panama, our model suggests that the competitive
            inequalities caused by interspecific variation in CNDD may undermine many species' ability to persist. Thus, our model suggests that variable
            CNDD may make communities less stable, rather than more stable.

abstract = {: Pollinator-mediated interactions between plants can play an important role for the dynamics of plant communities. Pollination services depend on the abundance and the foraging behaviour of pollinators, which in turn respond to the availability and distribution of floral resources (notably nectar sugar). However, it is still insufficiently understood how the 'sugar landscapes' provided by flowering plant communities shape pollinator-mediated interactions between multiple plant species and across different spatial scales. A better understanding of pollinator-mediated interactions requires an integrative approach that quantifies different aspects of sugar landscapes and investigates their relative importance for pollinator behaviour and plant reproductive success. In this study, we quantified such sugar landscapes from individual-based maps of Protea shrub communities in the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. The 27 study sites of 4 ha each jointly comprise 127 993 individuals of 19 species. We analysed how rates of visitation by key bird pollinators and the seed set of plants respond to different aspects of sugar landscapes: the distribution of nectar sugar amounts, as well as their quality, taxonomic purity and phenology. We found that pollinator visitation rates strongly depended on phenological variation of site-scale sugar amounts. The seed set of focal plants increased with nectar sugar amounts of conspecific neighbours and with site-scale sugar amounts. Seed set increased particularly strongly if site-scale sugar amounts were provided by plants that offer less sugar per inflorescence. These combined effects of the amount, quality, purity and phenological variation of nectar sugar show that nectar sugar is a common interaction currency that determines how multiple plant species interact via shared pollinators. The responses of pollinator-mediated interactions to different aspects of this interaction currency alter conditions for species coexistence in Protea communities and may cause community-level Allee effects that promote extinction cascades., (C) 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd},

Body size differences among frugivores are hypothesized to affect seed dispersal distances and consequently their effectiveness as dispersers. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the effectiveness of two passerine birds, grackles (Onychognathus tristramii) and bulbuls (Pycnonotus xanthopygos), dispersing the desert shrub Ochradenus baccatus. Laboratory experiments, quantifying gut retention time and the effect on germination, were combined with field observations quantifying bird movements and fruit consumption rates. An empirically parameterized mechanistic model showed that the two dispersers switch roles as a function of spatial-scale: while most seeds within the local habitat were dispersed by bulbuls, the larger grackles were exclusively responsible for between-patches, long-distance dispersal. We suggest that distance-related differences are common and important to plant fitness, and thus should explicitly be considered in studies of disperser effectiveness.},

abstract = {Understanding how ecological processes structure species assemblages is a central issue in community ecology. While the influence of plant–pollinator interactions on each other's evolution is well recognized, their role in the assembly of interdependent communities of plants and pollinators is still unclear. Using data from seven communities of hummingbirds and plants that they pollinate from two tropical rain forest types (lowland and montane), we evaluated phylogenetic relationships and signal of functional traits, over space and time, to test predictions on the main processes (environmental filtering, facilitation or competition) that are driving these hummingbird–plant assemblages. Our findings suggest that the main processes driving these assemblages varied between hummingbirds and plants and between habitats, and even among communities at the same habitat. The non-conserved floral trait and the phylogenetic patterns (even or random) give support to the hypothesis of facilitation or competition as processes regulating the composition of plant assemblages. Moreover, the positive relationship between fitness and flowering synchrony suggests facilitation as the most important mechanism for montane plant communities. Distinctively, for lowland plant communities, the combination of non-conserved traits and clustered phylogenetic patterns may be a result of either adaptive radiation or biotic filtering driven by a particular pollinator species that plays a main role as plant community organizer. Lastly, evidence of trait conservatism, together with clustered or even phylogenetic patterns, suggests that facilitation or competition may drive the assembly of montane hummingbird communities, despite the predominance of random phylogenetic patterns. Synthesis. Overall, we present a pathway to identify central ecological processes that may drive the assembly of plant–pollinator communities. We show that different processes related with pollination that vary in space and time may contribute to the assembly of the interdependent tropical communities of plants and pollinators.

abstract = {Nectar robbers are animals that extract the nectar produced by plants without effecting pollination. These animals can have negative, positive, or neutral effects on the interaction, depending on the direct and indirect effects of each participant in the system. The purpose of this work was to analyze the prevalence of nectar robbing and its tem- poral dynamics in a tropical highland forest in western Mexico. The system was studied in terms of the seasonal changes in (i) specific composition and abundance of hummingbird pollinators, their hosts, and the nectar robbers, (ii) use of resources by the nectarivorous birds and flowers, and (iii) prevalence of flower piercing by the cinnamon flowerpiercer, Diglossa baritula. The guild consisted of 17 species of hummingbirds, 2 species of nectar robbers, and 21 plant species that were visited by nectarivorous birds (robbers and pollinators). The relative abundance of birds and available flowers showed two peaks, one in winter and the other in the rainy season. Some plant species were used more than expected from their abundance. Overlap in the use of flowers among hummingbirds and also between hum- mingbirds and the nectar robbers was high. Nectar robbing was found to be widespread, occurring in almost all of the plants known to be hummingbird pollinated. The ratio of hummingbirds to nectar robbers was around 10 throughout the year.},

abstract = {The effect of gulls, blackbirds and rabbits on the viability and germination of Corema album seeds are compared. Frugivores can affect seed viability and germination (1) directly, through the effect of ingestion and (2) indirectly, dispersing seeds to different sites with different conditions. These two major factors in the quality of a seed disperser are not necessarily concordant in direction and magnitude. Gulls and blackbirds have similar direct effects, being much better than those of rabbits, due to the low probability of germination of seeds within rabbit pellets. Seed germination occurs mainly in the open ground, particularly in the sparse scrub, and is very low under vegetation cover. This pattern becomes crucial determining the indirect effects of seed dispersers that will depend on their capacity to carry seeds to the most suitable sites for germination. Gulls and rabbits disperse most of seeds to open ground, exerting a positive indirect effect on germination, whereas blackbirds disperse seeds mainly under shrubs, thus exerting a negative indirect effect. Direct and indirect effects on seed germination are concordant for gulls but discordant for blackbirds and rabbits. Gulls were the best dispersers; the overall probability of germination for a seed dispersed by gulls was 17.59{\%}. The quality of blackbirds and rabbits was relatively low (3.49{\%} and 1.17{\%}, respectively). Frugivores seem to be essential for germination of C. album seeds, not as much for their direct effects but for their ability to carry seeds to suitable sites. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier SAS.

In U.S. environmental markets, early action could reduce lags in environmental performance, improve outcomes, and encourage innovation in mitigation approaches. Multiple tools have emerged for encouraging early action in environmental markets. Several tools have also been deployed in markets, providing valuable insight into their function. This paper presents a systematic review of early action tools and describes their use in wetland and stream mitigation, species and habitat banking, greenhouse gas mitigation, and water quality trading. It finds that incentives necessary to motivate sellers differ from those motivating buyers. The tool or approach best suited to encourage early action also varies as conditions change. Anecdotal evidence suggests the potential for benefits to accrue from early action, but additional data are needed to inform the use of specific tools.},

As a response to this challenge, we report on a meta-analysis of the correlates of belief in climate change. Twenty-seven variables were examined by synthesizing 25 polls and 171 academic studies across 56 nations. Two broad conclusions emerged. First, many intuitively appealing variables (such as education, sex, subjective knowledge, and experience of extreme weather events) were overshadowed in predictive power by values, ideologies, worldviews and political orientation. Second, climate change beliefs have only a small to moderate effect on the extent to which people are willing to act in climate-friendly ways. Implications for converting sceptics to the climate change cause—and for converting believers' intentions into action—are discussed.},

abstract = {With global and regional communities outlining their goals for RES use, such as the European Union issuing the Renewable Energy Directive mandating its member countries to achieve a 20{\%} overall share of renewable energy by 2020, it is undoubtedly an important source of energy in the near future. Ultimately however, it boils down to how willing households are in migrating to its use from conventional energy sources. Numerous valuation studies have been done to estimate the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for RES, but these studies do not seem to reach a reasonable consensus on how much households are actually willing to pay. Their findings vary considerably due to differences in, among others, sampling designs, valuation techniques, and types of renewable energy. To address this issue, the main objectives of our paper are to calculate a summary WTP estimate from the many reported estimates, and to explain the determinants of variations in WTP. Using a random-effect meta-analytic approach, we obtain a summary WTP estimate of USD7.16. On average, households are willing to pay an increase of this amount per month over the price of energy they are currently paying for, to shift to RES use. We then specify a random-effect meta-regression model to explain the variations in the households' WTP. From our model, we find metropolitan residents and North American households to have higher WTP than their rural and Asian counterparts. We also find evidence of genuine underlying empirical effects that more and more households are increasingly willing to pay for RES use. The types of RES do not appear to have any impact on WTP.},

But citizen-science projects vary in their ability to contribute usefully for science, conservation, or public policy. eBird has evolved from a basic citizen-science project into a collective enterprise, taking a novel approach to citizen science by developing cooperative partnerships among experts in a wide range of fields: population and distributions, conservation biologists, quantitative ecologists, statisticians, computer scientists, GIS and informatics specialists, application developers, and data administrators. The goal is to increase data quantity through participant recruitment and engagement, but also to quantify and control for data quality issues such as observer variability, imperfect detection of species, and both spatial and temporal bias in data collection. Advances at the interface among ecology, statistics, and computer science allow us to create new species distribution models that provide accurate estimates across broad spatial and temporal scales with extremely detailed resolution. eBird data are openly available and used by a broad spectrum of students, teachers, scientists, NGOs, government agencies, land managers, and policy makers. Feedback from this broad data use community helps identify development priorities. As a result, eBird has become a major source of biodiversity data, increasing our knowledge of the dynamics of species distributions, and having a direct impact on the conservation of birds and their habitats. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Mangroves are among the most productive ecosystems in tropical and subtropical regions. Historically, mangroves are assumed to support artisanal fisheries, leading decision-makers to protect mangroves based on this premise. However, this relationship remains unclear, despite positive correlations obtained in different geographical regions. Here, we provide the first meta-analysis of the mangroves-fisheries linkage at a global level. After conducting a systematic review, 23 publications containing 51 studies estimating the mangrove-fishery linkage were obtained. A random effect model was used to estimate the effect size (Pearson's correlation coefficient) of each individual study as well as the overall effect size. We found strong evidence for the mangrove-fishery linkage with an overall effect size of r = 0.72 (95{\%} CI: 0.61-0.81), and substantial heterogeneity was observed (Q = 143.88, df = 50, P {\textless} 0.01). The countries where the studies were carried out were the only significant moderator (QM = 26.07, P {\textless} 0.01), while fisheries types (i.e. crab, fish, shellfish, prawn and total) and global regions were not good predictors of the relationship. Our results show that mangrove area is a good predictor of fishery catches overall, confirming the importance of conserving such habitats. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Background 2.8 billion people cook with solid fuels, resulting in almost 3 million premature deaths from household air pollution (HAP). To date, no systematic assessment of impacts on HAP of ‘improved' stove and clean fuel interventions has been conducted. Objective This systematic review synthesizes evidence for changes in kitchen and personal PM2.5and carbon monoxide (CO) following introduction of ‘improved' solid fuel stoves and cleaner fuels in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Methods Searches of published and unpublished literature were conducted through databases and specialist websites. Eligible studies reported mean (24 or 48 h) small particulate matter (majority PM2.5) and/or CO. Eligible interventions were solid fuel stoves (with/without chimneys, advanced combustion), clean fuels (liquefied petroleum gas, biogas, ethanol, electricity, solar) and mixed. Data extraction and quality appraisal were undertaken using standardized forms, and publication bias assessed. Baseline and post-intervention values and percentage changes were tabulated and weighted averages calculated. Meta-analyses of absolute changes in PM and CO were conducted. Results Most of the 42 included studies (112 estimates) addressed solid fuel stoves. Large reductions in pooled kitchen PM2.5(ranging from 41{\%} (29–50{\%}) for advanced combustion stoves to 83{\%} (64–94{\%}) for ethanol stoves), and CO (ranging from 39{\%} (11–55{\%}) for solid fuel stoves without chimneys to 82{\%} (75–95{\%}) for ethanol stoves. Reductions in personal exposure of 55{\%} (19–87{\%}) and 52{\%} (− 7–69{\%}) for PM2.5and CO respectively, were observed for solid fuel stoves with chimneys. For the majority of interventions, post-intervention kitchen PM2.5levels remained well above WHO air quality guideline (AQG) limit values, although most met the AQG limit value for CO. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses did not substantially alter findings; publication bias was evident for chimney stove interventions but this was restricted to before-and-after studies. Conclusions In everyday use in LMIC, neither ‘improved' solid fuel stoves nor clean fuels (probably due to neighbourhood contamination) achieve PM2.5concentrations close to 24-hour AQG limit values. Household energy policy should prioritise community-wide use of clean fuels.},

We present a meta-analysis of what drives deforestation and what stops it, based on the signs and significance of 5909 coefficients in 554 multivariate analyses. We find that forests are more likely to be cleared where economic returns to agriculture and pasture are higher, either due to more favorable climatological and topographic conditions, or due to lower costs of clearing forest and transporting products to market. Timber activity, land tenure security, and community demographics do not show a consistent association with either higher or lower deforestation. Population is consistently associated with greater deforestation, and poverty is consistently associated with lower deforestation, but in both cases endogeneity makes a causal link difficult to infer. Promising approaches for stopping deforestation include reducing the intrusion of road networks into remote forested areas; targeting protected areas to regions where forests face higher threat; tying rural income support to the maintenance of forest resources through payments for ecosystem services; and insulating the forest frontier from the price effects of demand for agricultural commodities.},

abstract = {A promising option to sequester carbon in agricultural soils is the inclusion of cover crops in cropping systems. The advantage of cover crops as compared to other management practices that increase soil organic carbon (SOC) is that they neither cause a decline in yields, like extensification, nor carbon losses in other systems, like organic manure applications may do. However, the effect of cover crop green manuring on SOC stocks is widely overlooked. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to derive a carbon response function describing SOC stock changes as a function of time. Data from 139 plots at 37 different sites were compiled. In total, the cover crop treatments had a significantly higher SOC stock than the reference croplands. The time since introduction of cover crops in crop rotations was linearly correlated with SOC stock change (R2=0.19) with an annual change rate of 0.32±0.08Mgha-1yr-1in a mean soil depth of 22cm and during the observed period of up to 54 years. Elevation above sea level of the plot and sampling depth could be used as explanatory variables to improve the model fit. Assuming that the observed linear SOC accumulation would not proceed indefinitely, we modeled the average SOC stock change with the carbon turnover model RothC. The predicted new steady state was reached after 155 years of cover crop cultivation with a total mean SOC stock accumulation of 16.7±1.5Mgha-1for a soil depth of 22cm. Thus, the C input driven SOC sequestration with the introduction of cover crops proved to be highly efficient. We estimated a potential global SOC sequestration of 0.12±0.03PgCyr-1, which would compensate for 8{\%} of the direct annual greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. However, altered N2O emissions and albedo due to cover crop cultivation have not been taken into account here. Data on those processes, which are most likely species-specific, would be needed for reliable greenhouse gas budgets.},

Here we present the development of an online database of measured methane mitigation strategies called MitiGate, currently comprising 412 papers. The database is accessible through an online user-friendly interface that allows data extraction with various levels of aggregation on one hand and data-uploading for submission to the database allowing for future refinement and updates of mitigation estimates as well as providing easy access to relevant data for integration into modelling efforts or policy recommendations. To demonstrate and verify the usefulness of the MitiGate database those studies where methane emissions were expressed per unit of intake (293 papers resulting in 845 treatment comparisons) were used in a meta-analysis. The meta-analysis of the current database estimated the effect size of each of the mitigation strategies as well as the associated variance and measure of heterogeneity. Currently, under-representation of certain strategies, geographic regions and long term studies are the main limitations in providing an accurate quantitative estimation of the mitigation potential of each strategy under varying animal production systems. We have thus implemented the facility for researchers to upload meta-data of their peer reviewed research through a simple input form in the hope that MitiGate will grow into a fully inclusive resource for those wishing to model methane mitigation strategies in ruminants.},

The Matlab-based simulator allows the comparison of a number of learning policies (represented as a series of .m modules) in the context of a wide range of problems (each represented in its own .m module) which makes it easy to add new algorithms and new test problems. State-of-the-art policies and various problem classes are provided in the package. The choice of problems and policies is guided through a spreadsheet-based interface. Different graphical metrics are included. MOLTE is designed to be compatible with parallel computing to scale up from local desktop to clusters and clouds. We offer MOLTE as an easy-to-use tool for the research community that will make it possible to perform much more comprehensive testing, spanning a broader selection of algorithms and test problems. We demonstrate the capabilities of MOLTE through a series of comparisons of policies on a starter library of test problems. We also address the problem of tuning and constructing priors that have been largely overlooked in optimal learning literature. We envision MOLTE as a modest spur to provide researchers an easy environment to study interesting questions involved in optimal learning.},

abstract = {We estimated visitors' willingness to pay (WTP) for a variety of environmental attributes in a protected area of the Atacama Desert, a biodiversity hotspot in northern Chile. By using a choice experiment, WTP was estimated for the protection of the following attributes: animals (mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds), pollinating insects, plants (cacti and woody shrubs), soil quality and pristine landscapes. Visitors placed economic value on all of the attributes. The marginal mean WTP/visitor for the single levels of variation in the attributes ranged from US{\$}4 (for supporting research on foxes) to US{\$}26 (for maintaining soil quality) per visitor per month. These results can contribute to deciding which attributes are likely to be successful at raising funds for conservation. Our approach may be relevant to protected areas of the world with high conservation values, little funding and a lack of large, charismatic species.},

abstract = {Worldwide, decision-makers and nongovernment organizations are increasing their use of citizen volunteers to enhance their ability to monitor and manage natural resources, track species at risk, and conserve protected areas. We reviewed the last 10 years of relevant citizen science literature for areas of consensus, divergence, and knowledge gaps. Different community-based monitoring (CBM) activities and governance structures were examined and contrasted. Literature was examined for evidence of common benefits, challenges, and recommendations for successful citizen science. Two major gaps were identified: (1) a need to compare and contrast the success (and the situations that induce success) of CBM programs which present sound evidence of citizen scientists influencing positive environmental changes in the local ecosystems they monitor and (2) more case studies showing use of CBM data by decision-makers or the barriers to linkages and how these might be overcome. If new research focuses on these gaps, and on the differences of opinions that exist, we will have a much better understanding of the social, economic, and ecological benefits of citizen science.},

abstract = {Seed dispersal is a key evolutionary process and a central theme in the population ecology of terrestrial plants. The primary producers of most land-based ecosystems are propagated by and maintained through various mechanisms of seed dispersal that involve both abiotic and biotic modes of transportation. By far the most common biotic seed transport mechanism is zoochory, whereby seeds, or fruits containing them, are dispersed through the activities of animals. Rodents are one group of mammals that commonly prey on seeds (granivores) and play a critical, often destructive, role in primary dispersal and the dynamics of plant communities. In North America, geomyid, heteromyid and some sciurid rodents have specialized cheek pouches for transporting seeds from plant source to larder, where they are often eliminated from the pool of plant propagules by consumption. These seed-laden rodents are commonly consumed by snakes as they forage, but unlike raptors, coyotes, bobcats, and other endothermic predators which eat rodents and are known or implicated to be secondary seed dispersers, the role of snakes in seed dispersal remains unexplored. Here, using museum-preserved specimens, we show that in nature three desert-dwelling rattlesnake species consumed heteromyids with seeds in their cheek pouches. By examining the entire gut we discovered, furthermore, that secondarily ingested seeds can germinate in rattlesnake colons. In terms of secondary dispersal, rattlesnakes are best described as diplochorous. Because seed rescue and secondary dispersal in snakes has yet to be investigated, and because numerous other snake species consume granivorous and frugivorous birds and mammals, our observations offer direction for further empirical studies of this unusual but potentially important channel for seed dispersal.},

abstract = {Oil and gas development in the southern San Joaquin Valley of California is extensive and has impacted natural habitats for sensitive species. The effects of this habitat loss and degradation on these species are not well understood. Our objective was to determine habitat characteristics, wildlife community composition, and species abundance relative to the level of oilfield development in saltbush scrub habitat. Sixteen study sites were identified with 4 each in areas with high ({\textgreater}100 well pads), medium (11–50 well pads), low (1–10 well pads), and no (0 well pads) oil field development, as measured by numbers of well pads with active oil production and the proportion of habitat disturbed. Surveys were conducted from March 2008 to May 2010 to assess the abundance and diversity of herbaceous plants, shrubs, birds, reptiles, and small and medium-sized mammals. As oilfield development and associated habitat disturbance increased, herbaceous plant cover and shrub abundance decreased while herbaceous plant diversity increased, largely due to colonization by non-native species. Among animals, generalist lizard, bird, and mammal species increased, as did non-endemic species particularly birds. Conversely, some endemic species, including several special status species, declined or were not detected as the level of oilfield development increased. Ecological community composition remains largely intact at low levels of oilfield development, but is profoundly altered at higher levels with some effects apparent at moderate levels. Best management practices such as spatially consolidating facilities, limiting road construction, and controlling non-native plants could reduce ecological impacts from oilfield activities in saltbush scrub habitat.},

Several studies have quantified seed removal in tem- perate American deserts, but few studies have been performed in tropical deserts. These studies have only quantified pre- or post-dispersal seed removal, thus underesti- mating the influence of seed removal. We evaluated pre- and post-dispersal seed removal in the columnar cactus Stenocereus stellatus in a Mexican tropical desert. • We performed selective exclosure experiments to estimate percentage of seeds removed by ants, birds and rodents during the pre- and post-dispersal phases. We also conducted field samplings to estimate abundance of the most common seed removers. • Birds (10–28{\%}) removed a higher percentage of seeds than ants (2{\%}) and rodents (1–4{\%}) during pre-dispersal seed removal. Melanerpes hypopolius was probably the main bird removing seeds from fruits. Ants (62–64{\%}) removed a higher percentage of seeds than birds (34–38{\%}) and rodents (16–30{\%}) during post-dispersal seed removal. Pogonomyrmex barbatus was probably the main ant removing seeds from soil. • Birds and ants are the main pre- and post-dispersal seed removers in S. stellatus, respectively. Further studies in other S. stellatus populations and plants with different life forms and fruit types will contribute to evaluate seed removal in tropical American deserts. INTRODUCTION},

We explored spatial association patterns between avian frugivores and blue fan palms in two natural palm patches of Baja California. Spatial patterns were analyzed at the individual tree and at 2 ha patches. We evaluated seed predation by vertebrates and invertebrates, and vertebrate seed dispersal around palms. Birds responded to fruit aggregation at the individual tree and the patch scales, but responses varied between patches. Palm fruit variables-the quantity and the phenological phase-and avian visits showed strong spatial aggregation and association at both scales in one patch, but not in the other. The intensities of seed predation and seed dispersal were significantly higher directly below palms than at {\textgreater}3 m away from them. Patches differed in the intensity of seed predation around palms and in the diversity of mammalian dispersers, but not in the intensity of seed dispersal. Blue fan palms function as important resources' focuses for a great number of animals that use palm oases as corridors, bringing seeds as they move and connecting isolated populations of palms. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Animal community structure influences plant community structure in many ways, one of which is varying post-dispersal seed predation rates by different, sometimes distantly related animal taxa. In fire-prone mediterranean-climate vegetation, such as California chaparral, rodents are commonly assumed to be the most effective post-dispersal seed predators, which would render them the main driver for soil seed bank dynamics. This is a critical issue because the most dominant species of the chaparral rely on dormant, persistent soil seed banks to recruit after wildfires. Here, we used a series of exclusion exper- iments in combination with close video observation to show that granivorous birds are more effective than rodents in removing seeds of Ceanothus papillosus,a fire-dependent obligate seeder shrub of the California chaparral. We furthermore used seed traps and germination experiments to show that C. papillosus can have extremely high seed production and expresses strong intra and inter-annual seed bank dynamics. We conclude in contrast to other studies, that granivorous birds, in addition to rodents, are major determinants of C. papillosus seed bank densi- ties. We also found that seed bank density increased between years, despite high seed predation rates. We conclude that high seed production in combination with small and dark seed design may help some seeds to stay undetected, thus allowing C. papillosus to build a sufficiently dense enough seed bank to regenerate after wildfire. Our results indicate that the ratio of granivorous birds to rodents has the potential to play a major role in shaping chaparral community structure by differentially impacting soil seed bank densities.},

abstract = {We studied avian dispersal of seeds from the hemiparasitic mistletoe Plicosepalus acaciae (Loranthaceae) to its tree hosts Acacia raddiana and A. tortilis in the Syrian-African Rift (Arava) valley, Israel. The Yellow-vented Bulbul (Pycnonotus xanthopygos) was the sole avian visitor observed feeding on mistletoe fruits. Bulbuls consumed mistletoe fruits whenever they were available, but the fruits only constituted a significant portion of the diet (71{\%} of foraging attempts) when they were most abundant. These birds are potentially good dispersal vectors of P. acaciae because they swallowed the fruit whole and defecated viable seeds that were covered in a viscid pulp, which allowed the seeds to adhere to substrates when voided. In addition, bulbuls spent a large proportion (66 - 93{\%}) of total observation time perched in Acacia trees, allowing for directed dispersal. Ephemeral river valleys (wadis) with high mistletoe infection were adjacent to those containing no infections, demonstrating that mistletoe dispersal is common within, but not among wadis. This is consistent with the flight behaviour in bulbuls, which do not typically move among wadis. We combined data on bulbul movements between Acacia trees with transit times of mistletoe seeds to create a hypothetical seed shadow as a function of distance from the parent mistletoe plant. Because they are directed dispersers, the movement patterns of bulbuls may explain the current distribution of P. acaciae in the Arava valley.},

abstract = {Seed dispersal is thought to be unpredictable and outside a plant's control. But directed seed dispersal by mutualistic birds can increase probabilities of germination and survival by the non-random deposition of seeds in suitable microhabitats. In the Sonoran Desert grasslands of southern Arizona (USA), bird-dispersed wild chiltepin peppers (Capscium annuum var. glabriusculum) grow in non-random association under bird-dispersed nurse trees and shrubs that serve as perches. We tested the hypothesis that the pattern is maintained by directional avian seed-dispersal patterns. Alternatively, post-dispersal processes, such as differential seed predation and seedling mortality, could create the associations. For 3 years, we sampled the bird-generated seed rain under desert trees in four chiltepin subpopulations, comparing seed dispersal into microhabitats of fleshy-fruited trees and non-fleshy-fruited trees. Celtis pallida (fleshy-fruited) and Prosopis vellutina (non-fleshy-fruited) trees accounted for {\textgreater} 90{\%} of the cover available for chiltepin recruitment. We tracked seedling emergence and survival in the two microhabitats and conducted a controlled seed-addition experiment to measure the effects of microhabitat, seed-addition density and temporal seed deposition on chiltepin emergence, growth and survival. Approximately twice as many bird-dispersed seeds arrived at fleshy-fruited microhabitats compared with non-fleshy microhabitats. The numbers of seeds arriving and the number of seedlings emerging in microhabitats the following year were positively correlated. Survival of naturally emerged seedlings was similar at both microhabitats, but the seed-addition experiment revealed that more seeds are able to emerge under the denser foliage of fleshy-fruited microhabitats. The experiment also shows a significant effect of temporal deposition: when seeds were added gradually in a microhabitat (emulating repeated avian seed deposition under perches) instead of all at once, seedling emergence increased twofold on average. Synthesis: Birds dispersed disproportionally high quantities of chiltepin seeds into favourable recruitment microhabitats, showing a case of directed dispersal. Birds also increase seedling emergence through the temporal deposition of seeds under fleshy-fruited trees, most likely as a result of reducing the odds of seed predation. A coupling between directed seed dispersal with classic facilitative plant-plant interactions leads to the formation of pattern and self-organization in a plant community.

abstract = {We documented avian consumers of the mistletoe Agelanthus natalitius in the field and quantified their effects on seed germination in captive studies. Seven bird species were frequently observed to feed on mistletoe fruits in the field, namely Cape Batis (Batis capensis), Cape White-eye (Zosterops virens), Red-fronted Tinkerbird (Pogoniulus pusillus), Red-winged Starling (Onychognathus morio), Dark-capped Bulbul (Pycnonotus tricolor), Speckled Mousebird (Colius striatus) and Village Weaver (Ploceus cucullatus). Of the four bird species used in captive feeding trials (Red-winged Starling, Speckled Mousebird, Village Weaver and Cape White-eye), most of the birds removed the pulp-cover of the mistletoe fruits and left the exposed seeds in potentially germinable condition. Red-winged Starlings ingested but then regurgitated the seeds and wiped their bills on a twig to dislodge the sticky viscin-covered seeds individually. Mistletoe seeds obtained from cages of Red-winged Starlings had the highest germination success of all the seeds obtained from the captive bird study. The handling of mistletoe fruits applied by all species of birds both in the field and in captivity showed that mistletoe dispersal is likely to occur over short distances, although the seeds are likely to be dispersed to safe sites due to directed dispersal on parental host trees. Such autoinfection and local aggregation increase the interaction with already parasitised hosts, which through time may enhance local specialisation on the most frequently parasitised host species. {\textcopyright} 2010 Dt.

abstract = {We investigated the regeneration of a threatened tree, the yew Taxus baccata, in relation to the presence of fleshy-fruited woody plants acting as seed dispersal foci as well as protecting yew recruits against ungulate herbivores. We seek to determine if local facilitative effects are consistent across landscape in the Cantabrian range (NW Spain). Yew seed rain by birds mostly concentrated under yew trees and beneath hollies flex aquifolium. Seedling emergence distributed similarly to seed rain, but first-year seedling survival was higher beneath hollies. In one site where woody vegetation was structured as nucleation centres (multispecific patches of fleshy-fruited plants acting as foci for seed rain) yew recruits mostly occurred in yew-dominated centres, suggesting dispersers-mediated facilitation. However, holly was the main nurse plant for most of these recruits, considering the nurse as the species whose canopy covered directly the yew recruit. Living beneath nurse plants reduced herbivore damage on saplings and enhanced seedling survival. A planting experiment with yew rooted-cuttings beneath different spiny shrubs corroborated this effect. Additional evidence on yew recruitment limitation by herbivory emerged from one population where ungulates were fence-excluded. Our results suggest that nurse plants mitigate the negative effect of herbivores on yew regeneration, by providing defence against browsing and trampling. Shelter ability related to nurse structure, cone-shaped shrubs with branches at their bases acting better as a barrier. Paradoxically, this structure resulted from heavy browsing on nurse plants. The study of yew regeneration and habitat structure in seven sites provided evidence for the consistency of facilitation by holly at the landscape level, since local values of yew recruitment positively related to nurse ground cover. Range-scale yew management must consider the local functioning of the interaction among avian seed-dispersers, nurse fleshy-fruited plants and ungulate herbivores, in combination with regional measures, targeting the habitats where facilitation emerges.},

abstract = {Cactus flowers have traditionally been considered to be specialized to certain pollination guilds, but pollination studies reveal that most species are actually generalists. This suggests that floral traits are not always predictive of the animal visitors that pollinate cactus flowers. Here, we studied the pollination of Echinopsis leucantha (Gillies ex Salm-Dyck) Walp., an endemic cactus of Argentina, whose floral traits would suggest that it is pollinated by moths. The floral lifespan and flower availability throughout the reproductive period were evaluated. Field experiments were carried out to study the reproductive system and the identity and effectiveness of floral visitors. Echinopsis leucantha flowers had a nocturnal anthesis time that extended into the following morning. The species was self-incompatible. Floral visitors included moths, bees, and passerine birds. However, diurnal visitors were more effective as pollinators than nocturnal ones. The flowers of E. leucantha were phenotypically specialized (sphingophily); however, the pollination system was functionally and ecologically generalized. The results confirm that generalized pollination systems are widespread among species of the Echinopsis genus with nocturnal flowers, for which diurnal pollinators seem to have a key role in fruit and seed production. Our study constitutes the first record of passerine bird pollination in the Cactaceae for mainland South America.},

abstract = {The tree cactus Opuntia quimilo is one of three known gynodioecious cacti. Its flowers deviate from most Opuntias in features that are attributable to ornithophily: petals are shiny red in colour, and fleshy in consistency, a nectar chamber is present, and stamen seismonasty is lacking. Pollinators include large matinal bees (predominantly Ptilothrix tricolor and Megachile sp.) and hummingbirds (Chlorostilbon aureoventris and Heliomaster furcifer). Hummingbirds rarely visit other local Opuntias. Hummingbirds, which are more common in the afternoon, prefer female flowers whereas bees prefer hermaphroditic flowers. Female flowers have more dilute nectar than hermaphroditic flowers. Under experimental conditions female fertility is as high as that of hermaphrodites, however, seeds from females always result from cross-pollination and from more severe ovule selection (ovule number is higher in female flowers). Under natural conditions female plants are reproductively more successful than hermaphrodites. Known cases of bird pollination in Opuntia and the incidence of ornithophilic features in Opuntia and related genera are discussed.},

abstract = {Animals select habitat to satisfy life-history requirements, yet few habitat-selection studies consider multiple factors, especially food. Because resources vary in abundance and quality across different spatial scales or habitat types, selected habitat features may also vary, making habitat selection incongruent. Using an information-theoretical approach, we assessed whether Phainopeplas (Phainopepla nitens) select breeding habitat for food abundance or vegetation structure at nest-tree and nest-patch scales in two woodland types, acacia and mesquite, in the Mojave Desert. Habitat selection at the tree and patch scales was congruent: models containing both food (mistletoe) and structure variables had stronger support than models with only food or structure variables. In both woodland types, nest trees were larger and had more food, and in nest patches food abundance, tree density, tree height, and cover were greater than in non-nest patches. However, nests in acacia were higher than those in mesquite, acacia nest trees were smaller and had more food but less cover, and acacia nest patches had lower tree density and more food. These differences between woodland types apparently led to incongruence in nest-site selection: the difference between height of nest and non-nest trees was greater in shorter acacia than in mesquite woodlands, and the difference in food abundance between nest and non-nest sites was greater in food-poor mesquite woodlands. Contrary to assertions that vegetation structure drives nest-site selection, Phainopeplas' nest-site selection reflects both food abundance and vegetation structure at all spatial scales, underscoring the importance of multiple factors, scales, and habitats to habitat-selection studies.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyse the reproductive biology of Echinopsis terscheckii, a species endemic to northwest Argentina that has nocturnal flowers. We expected that this species had a generalised pollination system, with moths and diurnal visitors as the primary pollinators. To test this, we studied the floral biology, breeding system and floral visitors of this species and the effectiveness of nocturnal and diurnal visitors. Floral biology was defined based on floral morphology, floral cycle and nectar production of the flowers. The breeding system and relative contributions of diurnal and nocturnal visitors to fruit and seed set were analysed through field experiments. E. terscheckii flowers opened at sunset and closed the following day. The peak of nectar production occurred at midnight. Flowers were determined to be self-incompatible. Moths, bees and birds were identified as floral visitors. Moths were the most frequent visitors at night, whereas bees were the most frequent visitors during the day. Fruit production by diurnal pollinators was less than that by nocturnal pollinators; among all floral visitors, moths were the most effective pollinators. We have demonstrated for the first time that moths are the primary pollinators of columnar cacti of the genus Echinopsis. Our results suggest that moths might be important pollinators of columnar cactus species with nocturnal flowers in the extra-tropical deserts of South America.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that there is a geographic dichotomy in the pollination systems of chiropterophilous columnar cacti: in intra-tropical areas they are pollinated almost exclusively by bats, whereas in extratropical areas they are pollinated by bats, birds and bees. However, currently the studies are clumped both taxonomically (mainly Pachycereeae species) and geographically (mainly in the Tehuacan Valley and the Sonoran Desert). This clumping limits the possibility of generalising the pattern to other regions or cactus tribes. Only four of the 36 chiropterophilous cacti in Pilosocereus have been studied. Despite the tropical distribution of two Pilosocereus species, bees account for 40-100{\%} of their fruit set. We examined how specialised is the pollination system of P. leucocephalus in eastern Mexico. As we studied tropical populations, we expected a bat-specialised pollination system. However, previous studies of Pilosocereus suggest that a generalised pollination system is also possible. We found that this cactus is mainly bat-pollinated (bats account for 33-65{\%} of fruit set); although to a lesser degree, diurnal visitors also caused some fruit set (7-15{\%}). Diurnal visitors were more effective in populations containing honeybee hives. P. leucocephalus is partially self-compatible (14-18{\%} of fructification) but unable to set fruit without visitors. Despite the variation in pollination system, P. leucocephalus shows more affinity with other columnar cacti from tropical regions than with those from extratropical regions. Although we report here that a new species of tropical Pilosocereus is relatively bat-specialised, this Cereeae genus is more flexible in its pollination system than the Pachycereeae genera.},

abstract = {Many cactus species produce 'bird' flowers; however, the reproductive biology of the majority of these species has not been studied. Here, we report on a study of the pollination of two species from the Cleistocactus genus, cited as an ornithophilous genus, in the context of the different ways in which they are specialised to bird pollination. In addition, we re-evaluate the level of specialisation of previous studies of cacti with bird pollination and evaluate how common phenotypic specialisation to birds is in this family. Both Cleistocactus species exhibited ornithophilous floral traits. C. baumannii was pollinated by hummingbirds, whereas C. smaragdiflorus was pollinated by hummingbirds and bees. Pollination by birds has been recorded in 27 cactus species, many of which exhibit ornithophilous traits; however, they show generalised pollination systems with bees, bats or moths in addition to birds being their floral visitors. Of all cactus species, 27{\%} have reddish flowers. This trait is associated with diurnal anthesis and a tubular shape. Phenotypic specialisation to bird pollination is recognised in many cactus species; however, it is not predictive of functional and ecological specialisation in this family.

abstract = {We studied floral visitors and traits of claret cup cactus (Echinocereus Coccineus) at six sites and three elevations along a 1200-m gradient in the Chiricahua Mountains, Arizona. Although elevation affected flowering time, it had little effect on the size distribution or taxonomic classes of visitors. Hummingbirds visited at all sites and relative visit rates of large (7 g) and small (3 g) hummingbirds were similar at each elevation. Males of large species visited more commonly than females, whereas the reverse was true for small hummingbirds. Halictid bees visited commonly at all elevations, but other insects were rare. The survey of visitors revealed no elevation-related patterns that would select for differentiation in floral traits. However, flower length and correlated traits (distance from nectar chamber to anthers and stigma) increased significantly with elevation, with maximum differences of 15-18{\%}, indicating a possible advantage of large flower size at higher elevations. Flower width and nectar chamber size did not vary significantly. Nectar production rate tended to increase with elevation, but differences were nonsignificant and overshadowed by wide variation among plants at a site. Claret cup flowers are huge and highly rewarding compared to sympatric hummingbird flowers from other plant families. Flower length and width averaged 68 mm and 30 mm, respectively, and daily nectar production averaged 30 mg sugar/flower. This set of traits represents a syndrome rare among hummingbird flowers in which the flower fits the head rather than just the bill, and birds are well rewarded for a risky or inconvenient visit. },

abstract = {/ Effects of protective fencing on birds, lizards, black-tailed hares (Lepus californicus), perennial plant cover, and structural diversity of perennial plants were evaluated from spring 1994 through winter 1995 at the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area (DTNA), in the Mojave Desert, California. Abundance and species richness of birds were higher inside than outside the DTNA, and effects were larger during breeding than wintering seasons and during a high than a low rainfall year. Ash-throated flycatchers (Myiarchus cinerascens), cactus wrens (Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus), LeConte's thrashers (Toxostoma lecontei), loggerhead shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus), sage sparrows (Amphispiza belli), and verdins (Auriparus flaviceps) were more abundant inside than outside the DTNA. Nesting activity was also more frequent inside. Total abundance and species richness of lizards and individual abundances of western whiptail lizards (Cnemidophorous tigris) and desert spiny lizards (Sceloporus magister) were higher inside than outside. In contrast, abundance of black-tailed hares was lower inside. Structural diversity of the perennial plant community did not differ due to protection, but cover was 50{\%} higher in protected areas. Black-tailed hares generally prefer areas of low perennial plant cover, which may explain why they were more abundant outside than inside the DTNA. Habitat structure may not affect bird and lizard communities as much as availability of food at this desert site, and the greater abundance and species richness of vertebrates inside than outside the DTNA may correlate with abundances of seeds and invertebrate prey.

The production of flowers, branches, and spines from areoles is reviewed, as well as current methods for estimating individual age despite great variability in growth rates, most notably linked to summer rainfall.

abstract = {Extreme high environmental temperatures produce a variety of consequences for wildlife, including mass die-offs. Heat waves are increasing in frequency, intensity, and extent, and are projected to increase further under climate change. However, the spatial and temporal dynamics of die-off risk are poorly understood. Here, we examine the effects of heat waves on evaporative water loss (EWL) and survival in five desert passerine birds across the southwestern United States using a combination of physiological data, mechanistically informed models, and hourly geospatial temperature data. We ask how rates of EWL vary with temperature across species; how frequently, over what areas, and how rapidly lethal dehydration occurs; how EWL and die-off risk vary with body mass; and how die-off risk is affected by climate warming. We find that smaller-bodied passerines are subject to higher rates of mass-specific EWL than larger-bodied counterparts and thus encounter potentially lethal conditions much more frequently, over shorter daily intervals, and over larger geographic areas. Warming by 4 °C greatly expands the extent, frequency, and intensity of dehydration risk, and introduces new threats for larger passerine birds, particularly those with limited geographic ranges. Our models reveal that increasing air temperatures and heat wave occurrence will potentially have important impacts on the water balance, daily activity, and geographic distribution of arid-zone birds. Impacts may be exacerbated by chronic effects and interactions with other environmental changes. This work underscores the importance of acute risks of high temperatures, particularly for small-bodied species, and suggests conservation of thermal refugia and water sources.},

abstract = {Seed dispersal by animals is a complex process involving several distinct stages: fruit removal by frugivores, seed delivery in different microhabitats, seed germination, seedling establishment, and adult recruitment. Nevertheless, studies conducted until now have provided scarce information concerning the sequence of stages in a plant's life cycle in its entirety. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the immediate consequences of frugivore activity for Eugenia umbelliflora (Myrtaceae) early recruitment by measuring the relative importance of each fruit-eating bird species on the establishment of new seedlings in scrub and low restinga vegetation in the Atlantic rainforest, Brazil.We conducted focal tree observations on E. umbelliflora trees recording birds' feeding behaviour and post-feeding movements.We also recorded the fate of dispersed seeds in scrub and low restinga vegetation.We recorded 17 bird species interacting with fruits in 55 h of observation. Only 30{\%} of the handled fruits were successfully removed. From 108 post flight movements of exit from the fruiting trees, 30.6{\%} were to scrub and 69.4{\%} to low restinga forest. Proportion of seed germination was higher in low restinga than in the scrub vegetation. Incorporating the probabilities of seeds' removal, deposition, and germination in both sites, we found that the relative importance of each frugivorous bird as seed dispersers varies largely among species. Turdus amaurochalinus and Turdus rufiventris were the best dispersers, together representing almost 12{\%} probability of seed germination following removal. Our results show the importance of assessing the overall consequence of seed dispersal within the framework of disperser effectiveness, providing a more comprehensive and realistic evaluation of the relative importance of different seed dispersers on plant population dynamics.},

abstract = {Many avian species of the North American Sonoran desert, e.g., the black-throated sparrow, Amphispiza bilineata, cactus wren, Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus, and curve-billed thrasher, Toxostoma curvirostre, can potentially breed from March/April to August. It is possible that, at least in summer, intense heat and aridity may have inhibitory effects on breeding by precipitating a stress response. Stress typically results in a rise in secretion of adrenocorticosteroid hormones that then inhibit reproduction by suppressing release of gonadal hormones. However, we found that plasma levels of corticosterone were not higher during summer, compared with winter, even in 1989 when summer temperatures were higher than normal. In June 1990, temperatures were also above normal and soared to the highest level recorded in Arizona (50 degrees C). Plasma levels of corticosterone during June were high in black-throated sparrows, but less so in two other species (Abert's towhee, Pipilo aberti, and Inca dove, Scardafella inca) found in more shady riparian and suburban habitat with constant access to water. The adrenocortical response to stress (as measured by the rate of corticosterone increase following capture) was reduced in the hottest summer months in black-throated sparrows, cactus wrens, and curve-billed thrashers, but less so in Abert's towhee an Inca dove. These data suggest that at least some birds breeding in the open desert with restricted access to water are able to suppress the classical adrenocortical response to stress. The response is then reactivated in winter after breeding has ceased. It is possible that this stress modulation may allow breeding to continue despite severe heat. Analysis of plasma from these species indicated that the apparent modulation of the adrenocortical response to stress was not an artifact of reduced affinity or capacity of corticosterone binding proteins.},

abstract = {Cacti, particularlyOpuntia ficus-indica(=O. ficus-barbarica), were introduced to Spain at the end of the 15th century and from there spread over the whole Mediterranean Basin. They have been used for almost 500 years as a fruit crop, a defensive hedge, a support for cochineal production of dye (carminic acid) and, more recently, as a fodder crop and as a standing buffer feed for drought periods; they can also play a key role in erosion control and land rehabilitation, particularly in arid and semi-arid zones, and as a shelter, refuge and feed resource for wildlife (birds and mammals alike). This article analyses the ecological requirements of cacti and particularly of the common and most utilized spineless type,Opuntia ficus-indicaformainermis, its drought-tolerance, food and feed value for humans, herbivores and fructivores and its potential for land rehabilitation, cheap and easy erosion control and the rational use of marginal land. Cactus plantations and hedges probably cover about 1,000,000 ha in the Basin (includingO. ficus-indicaformaamyclaea), particularly in the Mediterranean islands and North Africa; but, unlike in other subtropical zones, cacti have never become an invasive pest in the Basin. The spineless cacti never become invasive pests anyway, as they are grazed out, unless totally protected from herbivores, either naturally (cliffs) or artificially (fences).},

abstract = {Tristerix aphyllus (Loranthaceae) is a bird-dispersed mistletoe that infects several cactus species in central and north-central Chile. At Las Chinchillas National Reserve it parasitizes two species of columnar cacti (Echinopsis chilensis and Eulychnia acida) and its seeds are dispersed exclusively by the Chilean mockingbird Mimus thenca. The prevalence of T. aphyllus on cacti depended on host species and size. Echinopsis chilensis was parasitized at a higher, and E. acida at a lower, frequency than expected from their relative abundances. In both species, the incidence of T. aphyllus parasitism increased with cactus height. Birds perched and deposited seeds primarily on parasitized cacti, which resulted in an aggregated distribution of seeds. By preventing bird perching and thus reducing seed deposition, the long spines of E. chilensis and E. acida may help protect cacti against T. aphyllus infestation. However, the seeds of T. aphyllus produced a slow-growing radicle that reached up to 91 mm long in 43 days. Radicles of this length are unique among mistletoe species and may have evolved to overcome the barrier posed by cactus spines},

Lesions of the dentate gyrus or the CA3, but not the CA1, subregion of the hippocampus induced a deficit in the acquisition of the task with short-term delays (i.e., 10 sec) and impaired performance of the task in a novel environment. All subregional lesions produced sustained impairment in performing the task with intermediate-term delays (i.e., 5 min) when rats were tested in a familiar environment. The results suggest a dynamic interaction among the dorsal hippocampal subregions in processing spatial working memory, with the time window (i.e., delay) of a task recognized as an essential controlling factor.},

Methylmercury developmental neurotoxicity has constituted the basis for risk assessments and public health policies. Despite gaps in our knowledge on new bioindicators of exposure, factors that influence MeHg uptake and toxicity, toxicokinetics, neurologic and cardiovascular effects in adult populations, and the nutritional benefits and risks from the large number of marine and freshwater fish and fish-eating species, the panel concluded that to preserve human health, all efforts need to be made to reduce and eliminate sources of exposure. {\textcopyright} Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2007.},

abstract = {Resolving human-wildlife conflict is a conservation priority, but effective mitigation requires in-depth understanding of the complexity and relative importance of conflict drivers. We conducted 262 semi-structured interviews with villagers around Tanzania's Ruaha National Park. The surveys provided data on respondents' perceived problems with wildlife, knowledge, reported killing of carnivores, and their socio-economic characteristics. 98.5{\%} of people perceived a problem with wildlife, and respondents viewed large carnivores as significantly more problematic than other species, due to the threats they posed to livestock and humans. Despite this, only 7.3{\%} of people admitted to having killed any large carnivores. Depredation was widespread, having affected 61.1{\%} of households, but was less important than other forms of stock loss - monthly recall data revealed 1.2{\%} of stock were predated, compared to 9.1{\%} lost to disease and 2.8{\%} to theft. Although experience of depredation significantly predicted negative attitudes towards carnivores, it was not the most important factor. The study raises the possibility of 'contagious conflict', where perceived problems with one group of species were strongly associated with perceived problems with others. Furthermore, factors such as ethnic group and religious beliefs were significant predictors of perceived problems. This study suggests that effective conflict mitigation should involve measures to improve attitudes towards a broad range of species, rather than a single taxon, and that action should be taken to also address the social and cultural drivers of conflict, rather than merely focusing upon reducing wildlife damage.},

This view is based on field surveys and controlled experiments showing that species richness correlates negatively with high productivity and nitrogen enrichment. However, as the type of nutrient limitation has never been examined on a large geographical scale the causality of these relationships is uncertain. We investigated species richness in herbaceous terrestrial ecosystems, sampled along a transect through temperate Eurasia that represented a gradient of declining levels of atmospheric nitrogen deposition--from approximately 50 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in western Europe to natural background values of less than 5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in Siberia. Here we show that many more endangered plant species persist under phosphorus-limited than under nitrogen-limited conditions, and we conclude that enhanced phosphorus is more likely to be the cause of species loss than nitrogen enrichment. Our results highlight the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms of phosphorus enrichment, and for a stronger focus on conservation management to reduce phosphorus availability.},

abstract = {Despite the fundamental dependence of human populations on water resources, a range of anthropogenic impacts, in particular the removal of riparian vegetation, threaten freshwater environments. One of the most effective means of evaluating the effects of anthropogenic disturbance in aquatic ecosystems is the use of bioindicators, and the insects of the order Odonata are among the most efficient indicators, due to their enormous sensitivity to environmental changes. In this context, the present study aimed to verify which parameters of the odonate community (species richness, abundance/biomass, composition, taxonomic diversity and taxonomic/phylogenetic distinctness) are most effective for the evaluation of the loss of environmental integrity. The study focused on 50 streams in the northeast of the Brazilian state of Par{\'{a}}. The streams were sampled during the dry season, between June and August 2011. The physical characteristics of each stream were evaluated using a Habitat Integrity Index (HII). The species composition provided the best parameter for the evaluation of ecological integrity, providing a relatively accurate assessment at a lower mean research cost than other parameters. Taxonomic diversity and distinctness also provided relatively reliable results, contributed additional information on the evolutionary relationships among the odonate taxa, and also provided a low-cost approach. Deconstructing communities is necessary to detect impacts, considering the considerable variation in the environmental requirements of the different species. Overall, the parameter that best responded to gradients of disturbance was species composition, followed by diversity and taxonomic distinctness. Given these findings, odonate-based biomonitoring should focus on these parameters to guarantee the optimal detection and evaluation of habitat alterations.},

abstract = {Ephemeroptera is an important group of insects used in the bioassessment and monitoring of freshwater bodies worldwide because of their relative abundance in a wide variety of substrates and their increasing chances of detecting pollution impacts. In this study, their faunistic composition and spatiotemporal variations in density and diversity in River Orogodo (Southern Nigeria) was investigated at five ecologically distinct stations over a 12-month period. The mayfly nymph community responses to environmental variables were evaluated by means of biological measures and multivariate analysis (redundancy analysis [RDA]). Thirteen morphologically distinct taxa belonging to six families were identified. The dominant taxa were Afrobaetodes pusillus (23.1{\%}), Baetis sp. (13.7{\%}), and Caenis cibaria (11.4{\%}). The density of Ephemeroptera differed significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) both in space and time. Diversity was influenced by substrate heterogeneity which in turn was influenced by catchment processes such as flooding and anthropogenic activities especially abattoir effluent. Based on the RDA ordination and relative abundance data, Baetis sp. dominated at impacted stations while a more equitable distribution of species were observed in less disturbed sites. Water velocity, canopy cover, nature of bottom sediments, and the amount of dissolved oxygen also accounted for the variations in Ephemeroptera densities at the different stations. Shannon diversity, taxa richness, and evenness were lowest in station 3 (the abattoir discharge site).},

The enrichment factor (EF) and Index of geoaccumulation (Igeo) results showed that Cd was obviously enriched in all lakes and reached the moderate pollution level. A comparison of PHTE concentrations in the lake sediments from 2005 to 2015 found the PHTEs pollution status doubled. Multivariate statistical analysis identified the heavy industries of petroleum and steel in the cities close to lakes and excessive agricultural fertilizing in the region as possible pollution sources of the PHTEs. The H{\aa}kanson index method (RI) and the sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) were used to assess the potential risk of PHTEs in sediments. The risk degree of 11 lakes had reached a medium level of potential ecological risk except for one lake which had a low potential ecological risk status.

abstract = {Strategic retirement and restoration of agricultural lands is a critical conservation opportunity globally. The objective of this synthesis was to examine whether ecological habitat assessments, endan- gered species historical occurrence data, and restoration research can be used to develop evidence-based strategy for retiring and restoring agricultural lands. The San Joaquin Desert (SJD) of California is a promi- nent example because it experienced an extensive conversion to agriculture. Now, new groundwater regu- lations will lead to retirement on large areas of agricultural lands over the next 20 yr. This presents an opportunity to not only restore some of these lands but also explore the challenges associated with balanc- ing direct human needs with other ecosystem-level functions. California is thus an ideal case study for globally rethinking context-specific, single-case study solutions. We used a systematic review and synthesis to address the following three main questions for habitat recovery of endangered species in the SJD. (1) What are the habitat requirements for key endangered animal species in the region? (2) Is there historical evidence to support an assessment of suitable habitats for these species? (3) What restoration techniques apply to these species? Using the Web of Science and other resources, we reviewed over 1000 independent studies on this topic, refined the evidence, and selected a total of 266 relevant publications. Habitat require- ments for each species were described, but there was a critical need to examine quantitative thresholds for these factors to better evaluate habitat suitability of retired lands. There was sufficient evidence of historical vegetation to model suitable habitats and design the physical restoration of retired lands. Direct interven- tions associated with restoration strategies have been infrequently tested. Sparse and diverse evidence associated with direct experimental manipulations is not uncommon in applied ecology, and synthesis is an excellent tool for highlighting these gaps for future research to examine. This review suggests that retired agricultural land is a viable asset for threatened and endangered species, but to effectively advance restoration research and management, direct tests of restoration techniques and an assessment of relative costs for interventions are needed for a given region.},

abstract = {We examined the effects of Thymus vulgaris (common thyme) on associated vegetation in both its native and introduced range. We compared local (within-community) and landscape (among-community) species richness and community composition between thyme-dominated communities in France (native range) and New Zealand (introduced range). From 7 native sites (France) and 10 introduced sites (New Zealand), all plant species present in 20 (New Zealand, 25 in France) randomly placed 100 cm × 50 cm quadrats were recorded. Local species richness was determined by calculating mean species richness/quadrat inside and outside thyme-dominated plant communities and tested for significance with the factors of range and across sites. Landscape scale differences were determined by comparing total species richness inside and outside thyme communities across all sites from both ranges. Species differences between native and introduced thyme communities were analysed using similarity percentages. We found native range microenvironments with thyme harbour more species than microenvironments without thyme and this pattern was reversed in the introduced range with thyme decreasing local species richness. A higher percentage of shared species occurred both with and without thyme in the native range compared to the introduced range. In both ranges and across all sites (except for one) species composition of thyme-associated plant communities differed from communities without thyme. Native plant communities with thyme were more similar in species composition than plant communities without thyme, but in the introduced range species composition was most similar in plant communities without thyme. These results suggest thyme's ecosystem engineering consequences are context-dependent. Thyme may filter out competitive species that could negatively impact local species richness in its native range, but when introduced to a disturbed landscape in a novel biogeographic region, thyme reduces local species richness.},

@article{Castanho2015,
abstract = {Empirical studies in salt marshes, arid, and alpine systems support the hypothesis that facilitation between plants is an important ecological process in severe or 'stressful' environments. Coastal dunes are both abiotically stressful and frequently disturbed systems. Facilitation has been documented, but the evidence to date has not been synthesized. We did a systematic review with meta-analysis to highlight general research gaps in the study of plant interactions in coastal dunes and examine if regional and local factors influence the magnitude of facilitation in these systems. The 32 studies included in the systematic review were done in coastal dunes located in 13 countries around the world but the majority was in the temperate zone (63{\%}). Most of the studies adopt only an observational approach to make inferences about facilitative interactions, whereas only 28{\%} of the studies used both observational and experimental approaches. Among the factors we tested, only geographic region mediates the occurrence of facilitation more broadly in coastal dune systems. The presence of a neighbor positively influenced growth and survival in the tropics, whereas in temperate and subartic regions the effect was neutral for both response variables. We found no evidence that climatic and local factors, such as life-form and life stage of interacting plants, affect the magnitude of facilitation in coastal dunes. Overall, conclusions about plant facilitation in coastal dunes depend on the response variable measured and, more broadly, on the geographic region examined. However, the high variability and the limited number of studies, especially in tropical region, indicate we need to be cautious in the generalization of the conclusions. Anyway, coastal dunes provide an important means to explore topical issues in facilitation research including context dependency, local versus regional drivers of community structure, and the importance of gradients in shaping the outcome of net interactions.},

abstract = {Urbanisation is estimated to result in 6 billion urban dwellers by 2050. Cities will be exposed to climate change from greenhouse gas induced radiative forcing, and localised effects from urbanisation such as the urban heat island. An urban land-surface model has been included in the HadAM3 Global Climate Model. It shows that regions of high population growth coincide with regions of high urban heat island potential, most notably in the Middle East, the Indian sub-continent, and East Africa. Climate change has the capacity to modify the climatic potential for urban heat islands, with increases of 30{\%} in some locations, but a global average reduction of 6{\%}. Warming and extreme heat events due to urbanisation and increased energy consumption are simulated to be as large as the impact of doubled CO2 in some regions, and climate change increases the disparity in extreme hot nights between rural and urban areas.},

abstract = {Using historic data sets, we quantified the degree to which global change over 120 years disrupted plant-pollinator interactions in a temperate forest understory community in Illinois, USA. We found degradation of interaction network structure and function and extirpation of 50{\%} of bee species. Network changes can be attributed to shifts in forb and bee phenologies resulting in temporal mismatches, nonrandom species extinctions, and loss of spatial co-occurrences between extant species in modified landscapes. Quantity and quality of pollination services have declined through time. The historic network showed flexibility in response to disturbance; however, our data suggest that networks will be less resilient to future changes.},
